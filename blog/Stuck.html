      In this piece I'll attempt to provide some context around "progress" in the Web Platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can seem especially frustrating to a lot of developers that we don't have more elements "out of the box" as part of HTML. It seems like almost every week this comes up in some fashion or other.  Why is the web "stuck"?  Why did we "stop developing elements 10 years ago"?  And even "was the Extensible Web Manifesto just an entirely wrong turn"?  The trouble with these particular questions is that we don't begin them with a shared understanding of the data and similar perspective.  This is a piece I've been wanting to write for a while, so in this piece I'll try to shine a little light on the questions and provide some context.
    </p>
   

    <p>
      First, a thing to be aware of is that standards move at a different pace.


    </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10 years ago, HTML added PeerToPeerServer, later changed to WebRTC. 9, &lt;img crossorigin&gt;. 8, &lt;img srcset&gt;. 7, &lt;template&gt;. 6, &lt;picture&gt;. 5, &lt;slot&gt;. 4, &lt;script type=module&gt;. 3, &lt;link rel=serviceworker&gt;. 2, &lt;iframe allow&gt;. 1, form-associated custom elements. 0, &lt;img loading=lazy&gt;. <a href="https://t.co/CdPWKAnRCY">https://t.co/CdPWKAnRCY</a></p>— Simon Pieters (@zcorpan) <a href="https://twitter.com/zcorpan/status/1255207331014627329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    <p>
      First, 
    * Perspective
       * There actually has been high level progress
       * There has been far more low level progress
       * There are reasons 

    </p><p>Interactive elements on the web are... tricky.</p>

    <p>
      On the one hand, there's a lot to like about them. In theory, they can
      bring a simple declarative form with all kinds of goodness in terms of platform integration, portability and centralized work on accessibility and UX.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Unfortunately...
    </p>

    <pre class="wargames">...primary goal has not yet been achieved
&gt; What is the primary goal?
To win the game.</pre>

    <p>More simply: People still gravitate toward custom implmentations. It would appear to most developers that we're "stuck".</p>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">Why has it been hard to get developers to use native elements?</contextual-heading>
      <p>So many reasons.</p>
      <p>
        To start with, unfortunately many of the benefits of native interactive elemenets aren't exactly self-evident: It takes  time and education to be able to appreciate a lot of it. Buttons seem pretty basic, for example, but you can watch many of my friends talk about less immediately obvious of them for 45 minutes.  On the other hand, a whole lot easily observable, surface-level aspects of many are notoriously kind of frustrating.  
      </p>

    <p>But there's also the fact that we've been tackling, primarily, one <em>kind</em> of problem: Form controls.  Let's look at where we stand today</p>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="3"><pre>&lt;input type="WOPR"&gt;</pre></contextual-heading>

    <p>
      HTML's had a ton of investment in form-related interactive controls. However, in all this time there are an astonishing few <em>elements</em> because many of the controls are created based on
      <code>&lt;input type-"..."&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You've probably heard someone suggest that
      this is great because in cases where it isn't supported, simply
      providing the text field is fine. However, this is incomplete.</p>

    <p>
      In fact, this particular approach to that problem is actually quite problematic for a number of reasons and it's not the view held by implementers that this is a path we are eager to repeat.
    </p>


    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="4"><pre class="wargames">&gt; People sometimes make... mistakes.</pre></contextual-heading>

      <p>If you're interested in some history and developer-based reasons
      why this is frustrating, 
      <a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/a-story-about-input/">Monica Dinculescu's <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> I ♡ you, but you're
        bringing me down</a>
      is a great read. Many of these problems stem from us accepting the illusion
      presented that a date picker is a kind of text input. 
    </p>

    <figure class="captioned-image optional">
      <img data-src="/media/10-wargames-falken.png" alt="Faulken pointing to NORAD screens">
      <figcaption>Stephen Falken: Uh, uh, General, what you see on these screens up here is a fantasy; a computer-enhanced hallucination. Those blips are not real missiles. They're phantoms.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Realistically, a date picker <em>isn't</em> a text input.  Perhaps at an HTTP level, or even a database level, it's just a value - but controls are about how to <em>populate</em> values, and that's quite a different thing.  A date picker is a
      completely different complex control with potentially lots of complex interactions: Different things
      it needs to communicate, lots of sub-iteractions to manage, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>All of this is why you might hear people suggest "LSP" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">"Favor composition over inheritance"</a> as a better alternative.</p>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="5">Acceptable Losses?</contextual-heading>
      <p>At the end of the day, it seems that developers are left with some pretty unappealing choices.  Something is going to be sacrificed.</p>

      <p>
        Color pickers provide a great example of how this plays out in practice: Will developers building the sorts of tools that use a color picker allow a simple input field as the fallback until <em>every browser</em> ships something acceptable?  Seems like not much of a choice really.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sadly the story for 'polyfilling' an element also still isn't great: It's really just 'replacing it with something else entirely'.
        So, at the end of the day, you've got to go and find something that is a good quality stand in anyway.  Finally, since literally <em>everything your code relies on understanding them DOM</em>, and that stand in will have entirely <em>different</em> DOM, you now have two entirely different interactive trees to worry about. Yikes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, this isn't necessarily short lived, historically.  The reality is that lacking universal support can be the case for a long time: Native
        support for
        <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> was added to the last major
        browser... <em>Checks notes...</em> <strong>last year</strong>.
      </p>


      <p>
        Even after all of that... Guess what? It still isn't <em>acceptable</em>
        for a lot of people. It isn't styleable. It has entirely different UI and features everywhere. While this can occasionally be useful on some kinds of devices, it makes things like helpful documentation hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        And many of them (even the native ones) weren't super keyboard
        accessible either.
      </p>


      <p>
        Alternatively, a custom solution can solve all of these problems <em>now</em>... So it shouldn't actually be surprising that developers often
        choose a custom solution: There are no 'acceptable losses' for developers here - all of the choices are somehow bad.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="5">Learn, dammit.</contextual-heading>

      <p>
        You'll be happy to know that there <em>are</em> efforts to both learn and
        improve existing native interactive elements. If you haven't seen Greg
        Whitworth and Nicole Sullivan's talk
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFvPLrKZywA">HTML Isn't Done</a> from
        Chrome Dev Summit last year, I would highly recommend it (below).
      </p>

    <figure class="captioned-image optional">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFvPLrKZywA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There's also been a heck of a lot of work to make it possible for authors to
      define their own interactive elements that work just like the native ones. The
      idea is to help empower developers to help explore the space and try to help
      find the really sweet spots that strike all of the right balances.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's worth pointing out <em>why</em> this is useful - it's not just an
      academic exersize that is trying to push responsibility to developers. It's
      important because the truth is: <em>We don't actually know how</em>. We
      need to be able to throw lots of things at the wall and see what sticks.
      The trouble is, currently (historically) failure is <em>really</em> slow and
      <em>really</em> expensive -- and even our most educated 'guesses' at
      improvement are still just that: Guesses. We haven't proved we have this
      figured out yet.
        </p>

    <figure class="captioned-image optional">
      <img data-src="/media/wopr.jpeg" alt="WOPR">
      <figcaption>We need something like the WOPR for playing out possible answers without doing harm: failing, and learning - that's what the custom elements stuff is all about.</figcaption>
    </figure>
 

    <p>But let's flip the game around and talk about <em>non-form related interactive controls</em> - what does <em>that</em> game look like?

    </p><section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading id="different" role="heading" aria-level="6"><pre class="wargames">Shall we play a game?</pre></contextual-heading>

    <p>
      This is where things get really interesting to me - because a lot of components people really want <em>aren't</em> about forms at all.  And interestingly, realistically, we've come up with really only 1 strictly generic non-form-related UI control in 30 years: <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.
      We've had that supported universally since... <em>checks notes...</em>
      <strong>Jan 14, <em>2020</em></strong>. Again, it has most of the same kinds of general problems. In the most
      recent HTTP Almanac data, it was the 102nd most used HTML element... Can you
      even <em>name</em> 101 other HTML elements?
    </p>

    <p>So... This is terrible.</p>

    <p>
      Our continued problems in this space are part of the reason there is hesitancy
      to take up entirely <em>new</em> things... Like, tabs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in 2015, I managed to get a number of people in Web standards (especially
      a11y) interested in working on a possible new element proposal for HTML which
      would have which would have given not only the tabset but some other things as
      well. Determined not let this be doomed by the same sorts of stylability
      problems, we set out to define things that would become shadow parts and
      themes and custom properties and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, in many ways, it wasn't great. Recently, this has got me to thinking:
      What if this isn't even the right game we're playing? What if for
      <em>some</em> elements at least - non-form associated ones - the right lesson take away is that this is a unnecessary exercise in futility?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe we need a <em>different</em> kind of experiment: One that just says
      "Strange game. The only winning move is not to play".
    </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading id="chess" role="heading" aria-level="6"><pre class="wargames">How about a nice game of chess?</pre></contextual-heading>
    <p>
      So, here's the basic idea: What if we just created a resilient pattern
      focused on mainly <em>function</em> and <em>meaning</em> -- and
      <em>hardly at all on the UI aspect</em>. What if instead of inventing complex
      new ways to strike the balance of preventing authors from styling too much, we
      mostly just acknowledged the fact that they want to, and... let them.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if, like with <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> you could kind of just take
      control of the UI, but... maybe without throwing it away entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spoke with Greg Whitworth about this, who has been investigating how to improve the existing controls on the Web(see also <a href="http://gwhitworth.com/blog/2019/10/can-we-please-style-select/)">Can we please style select?</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, he completely agreed with the overall premise. He went described how...</p>

    <blockquote>
      The core mission of Open UI, a new W3C community group, is to document the anatamoies, behaviors and states of components and controls from across frameworks. By doing this, we can ensure that the key pieces that folks don't want to re-create, they don't have to. We've got a few different ideas that are beginning to take shape but changes like this are like peeling an onion. If it's a new control/component then it would be a bit more straight forward but the most painful controls we've found have been on the web since the 90s. So we'll be gathering telemetry and ensuring that any modifications we ultimately propose are web compatible.

      In our conversation we discussed how things like tabs seem like an interesting target where this kind of thing
      might just work really well. The particular shape of the tabs problem lends
      itself, I think, to easily trying something completely different and entirely without past baggage.</p>

    <p> 
      So, in that light 
      <a href="http://panel-set.glitch.me/">here's just such an experiment</a>
      which we think has some nice qualities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a declarative <em>decorator</em> over otherwise good but
        non-interactive semantics. That means there's no miss of differing
        interaction issues here caused by complex inheritance.
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't change your light DOM, and it <em>barely</em> uses Shadow DOM.
        There's no "two trees" problem, and there's not secrets or new
        challenges. Go ahead, use CSS and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        It adds the function, keyboard handling, accessibility stuff and a simple
        container for you. That's it, really.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you really <em>want</em> to opt in to some simple 'default styles' that
        might be passible if you don't care too much and like the 'minor tweaks
        only' approach, it has an attribute that enables 'native' look and
        feel which might be enough for some people.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So... that's it. It could for sure use more work, but WDYT? Would you try it out?  Let us know your thoughts?  Such experiments will be useful in informing work and directions for efforts like Open-UI and possible future standards.</p>

    <p>Will it help?  To be honest, I don't know, but maybe the right way to learn involves trying something really different, and I'm open to anything...</p>
