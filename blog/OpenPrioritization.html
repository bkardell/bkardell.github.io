	<h1 class="contextual-heading">Open Prioritization and Advocacy</h1>
	<p class="segue">I love the Web, and I want it to thrive.  It is an incredible open commons that makes so much of modern life possible, and better.  If you're reading this, chances are pretty good that the web has even enabled your career.  Mine too!  But there's also pretty good odds that you think <em>it could be better</em>.  I agree!  Let me tell you about an experiment at <em>visibly</em> making it better, together.</p>
	<style>
		.video-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; }

		.video-container iframe, .video-container object, .video-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }
	</style>
	<p>The web is 30 years old. In that time we've learned a lot about the problem space involved. I write a lot about the challenges we've faced, and am a regular advocate for the idea that we can do better.  I believe that when we lean on pragmatic answers and include more people as directly as possible, we all win.  The commons wins.  That's why I am so excited about our new experiment...</p>

	<div class="captioned-image" style="background-color: transparent;">
		<img src="/media/open-prioritization.png" alt="Open Prioritization, by Igalia: An experiment in crowdfunding prioritization">
	</div>


	<p>If you're a fan of The ShopTalk show, <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/407/">I first publicly discussed the idea there back in <em>April</em></a>. But, as you might have noticed, the world has been full of snags in 2020 and things got a little delayed.  But finally, here we are!</p>

	<p>There will be lots of posts describing what its about, it's a big idea. But, in a very few words: Here are six concrete web features that we can crowdfund together toward advancing actual work.  Here is a means of having a tangible voice in how we advance this commons that we all share.  Below is a short  (5 min) video that describes it and answers questions submitted by some friends we talked to about it early...</p>

	<div class="video-container captioned-image" style="background-color: transparent;">
		<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCRxNVbUqhk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>More details are available at <a href="https://igalia.com/open-prioritization">open-prioritization.igalia.com</a>, and that's where you can pledge, and it contains more details too.  But before you pledge anything, I'd like to offer some thoughts on it before you go.</p>

	<p>I think that we'll see that prioritization is <em>hard</em>.  I think we'll see that we probably don't all automatically agree on which thing is <em>most worthy</em> of prioritization.</p>

	<p><em>And that's ok</em>... In fact, it's really interesting.</p>

	<section class="sectioning">
		<h2 class="contextual-heading">Which of the 6 features best to support...</h2>

		<p>Everything is best.  It depends who you ask.  Part of the purpose of this experiment is to show that groups can find new ways to <em>advocate</em> and <em>work together to decide to do concrete things</em>. So let me attempt to do just that and get the ball rolling...</p>

		<p>Let me tell you how <em>I prioritized</em>, and why - and advocate for the ones I think are the best choices.  You can judge for yourself whether that makes sense and make your own decisions, or share your own advocacy.</p>

		<p>First off, note that you have a lot of expressive power here:  I pledged <em>something</em> to <em>everything</em> because I really believe in the idea.  I think think that changing the status quo and advancing <em>any</em> of these in a new way is a positive result.  What I did is vary <em>how much</em> I helped anything along the way to it's goal.  My minium was $5, my max was $40, but that could just as well be $1 or $5.  If you pledge $1, that is $1 worth of funding of the commons that didn't exist before and lots of $1's can get it done too.</p>

		<section class="sectioning">
			<h3 class="contextual-heading">The implmentation projects I pledged less to...</h3>

			<ul>
	
				<li>
					<p><strong>Selector list support for `<code>:not</code> in Chromium</strong>`</p>

					<p>I pledged $5 (1/9600th of the goal) to supporting selector lists in Chromium.  Chrome already spends way more than anyone else, and is by far the most dominant browser.  Generally speaking, I am more interested in helping to level things out.  Almost as importantly to me: It's only a second implementation - it doesn't achieve universality in the way some others do. Those are more valuable to me. A second implementation is better than a just first, and it's a necessary step along the way, for sure.  However, it still leaves me without for a while.  In a very tangible way, the last implementation is worth a lot.  Finally, while it offers something toward specifity issues, mostly, it's just sugar.  Would I like it? Sure, but it feels like there not a long of "bang for the buck".</p>
				</li> 

				<li>
					<p><strong>CSS <code>lab()</code>` colors in Firefox</strong></p>

					<p>I gave $5 toward CSS's lab colors in Firefox too (the same degree toward the goal as <code>:not</code>).  This was a tough one, I'm not going to lie. It is potentially very valuable, but it is the kind of investment you only fully realize at the end of several stages. This is, in fact, one of the reasons it's been slow to get traction. We have to get this to get colors level 5.   We want this in design tools.  But the real value is only when we have all of the next steps, even across the platform (like in canvas too).  It would also appear that this is not  yet a "cross the finish line" investment.</p>
				</li>


				<li>
					<p><strong>CSS <code>d</code> (SVG path) support in Firefox</strong></p>

					<p>I also pledged $5 toward supporting SVG (d) path in CSS in Firefox (but that is 1/2600th of the goal).  It seems less important than others to me on a number of counts.  It also doesn't help us cross a finish line: Once this is done, it still isn't in WebKit. That said, it is very good bang for the buck and I think we could get it done.</p>
				</li>
	
				<li>
					<p><strong>CSS <code>contain</code> in WebKit</strong></p>

					<p>I pledged $10 toward supporting containment in WebKit (1/7100th of the the goal).  Again, this is tough.  It is a last mile - only WebKit doesn't support it.  However, the price tag is much bigger too, and my big challenge here is that I don't know what the payoff really looks like is in practice. It can improve performance, which is great, but for me - it's extra.  It can be used in conjunction with ResizeObserver for some pretty good approximations of container queries, which is great too.  But it isn't <em>100% clear</em> that it is a necessary element for container queries. In fact, in <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/TowardResponsive.html">our proposal</a> and experiments to far, it isn't necessary for a whole bunch of use cases.  But... it's uncertain. If it turns out to be critical, and we haven't invested in it, it's only that much longer until we finally arrive. So... Sigh... That's a tough one.</p>
				</li>

			<h3 class="contextual-heading">My top choices: <code>inert</code> and <code>focus-visible</code></h3>

			<p>This leads me to my top choices: <code>:focus-visible</code> (I pledged $40 - 1/875th of the goal) and <code>inert</code> ($40 or 1 1200th of the goal)- both in WebKit.  </p>

			<p>Why these?  Well, because I think they are the most valuable in a lot of ways.   Of course, I'm biased:   I worked on the design and championing of both of these features with my friends Alice Boxhall and Rob Dodson, including writing and popularizing polyfills and iterating on the details with practical feedback and experience under our belts.  And now, here we are a few years later and these are <em>last miles</em> - only one browser doesn't have them implemented or isn't implementing yet.  We can change that.</p>

			<p>I did this work on my own time. as a developer, before I came to work for Igalia because there were real problems my teams were facing every day. Worse, they were right at the intersection of UX, DX and accessibility so the pains were very real.  So, let me tell you about what they are and why I think they're worth giving that last push.</p>

			<section class="sectioning">
				<h4 class="contextual-heading"><code>inert</code></h4>

				<p>There are a whole bunch of design patterns that require you to manage a whole bunch of other properties enmasse:  Make them unclickable, make their text unselectable, hide them from screen readers via ARIA, take them out of sequential focus temporarily.  Probably the easiest example of this is when a dialog is open - the rest of the page is 'there' but kind of 'inert'.  In fact, inert was as a term to the HTML specification when <code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code> was spec'ed.  But this isn't the only time when you want this behavior and, in fact, it is useful in a number of other use cases - but it's hard enough that even a lot of common UI libraries get it wrong.</p>

				<p><code>inert</code> exposes the ability to say "the stuff inside this element should be all of those things" in a simple way via a reflecting attribute - that is, you can set it in markup as an attribute, or via DOM property (which updates the attribute).</p>

				<p>You can read more about it, including other use cases and details <a href="https://github.com/WICG/inert/blob/master/explainer.md#use-cases">on the WICG explainer</a> (the related pull request to HTML itself is pending).</p>
			</section>

			<section class="sectioning">
				<h4 class="contextual-heading"><code>:focus-visible</code></h4>


				<p>Research shows that way too many people disable the focus indicator, at the cost of accessibility.  Well, there's kind of a rational explanation for why this happens so much, and that is that CSS's <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class is just plain broken.</p>

				<p>From very early days, browsers have used various heuristics to make the native focus ring valuable and, at the same time, unobtrusive.  There are times when an element gets focus where showing the indicator just <em>feels bad</em> and is there for no particularly really good reason for it to be there. The use cases are not all the same: If you click on a password field in a busy environment, for example, it's very important that you understand that your typed characters will land in the obscured field -- so you will <em>always</em> get a focus indicator.  If you click on a button, on the other hand, and it gets a focus indicator, that might be disorienting... <em>But</em> if you <em>keyboard navigate to that button</em>, then you <em>need</em> to see the indicator.</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, designs frequently don't "work" with only the native indicator, and the trouble is that traditionally the only tool that designers have to style the focus indicator is :focus, and it doesn't care about any of that.  The net result is that, unfortunately, attempting to use <code>:focus</code> to make the focus indicator work better for your site results in unfamilliar and disorienting UX for everyone.  Given only bad choices, the answer that too many make is the easy one: Simply disable it.</p>

				<p><code>:focus-visible</code>, on the other hand, only matches if the indicator would natively be shown, taking into account all of the browser UX research and preventing this disconnect.  It is, in our experience, provably easier to get right, and more successful.</p>

			<p>What about you, will you support something? Will you help advocate for the priority of something specific?  I (and we at Igalia at large) would love to hear your thoughts - share them on social media with the hashtag <code>#openprioritization</code> so that we can try to collect them.</p>
