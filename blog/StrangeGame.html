		<p>My posts frequently (like this one) have a 'theme' and tend to use a number of images for visual flourish. Personally, I like it that way, I find it more engaging and I prefer for people to read it that way.  However, for users on a metered or slow connection, downloading unnecessary images is, well, unnecessary, potentially costly and kind of rude.  Just to be polite to my users, I offer the ability for you to opt out of 'optional' images if the total size of viewing the page would exceed a budget I have currently defined as 200k...

    <p class="segue">
      It can seem especially frustrating to a lot of developers that we don't have more elements "out of the box" as part of HTML. I mean: <em>Where are the tabs? How do we not have tabs by now?</em> It seems like almost every week this comes up in some fashion or other. In this piece I'll talk a little about why, how to see this for what it is, how we're trying to move forward - and also present an interesting experiment for your consideration and feedback that may help inform some of these efforts.  If you want, you can <a href="#chess">skip right to the 'new idea/experiment'</a>, but I think this background is pretty helpful in understanding it, so please, come back and read it...</p>

    <p>
      Let's have a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">HTML so far</a>:  ~10 of the elements are the 'boilerplate stuff': html, body head and metadata stuff - link, meta, base,  style, script, title. ~30 are "weak sematics about text" that aren't interactive and don't have signficant (any) special meaning necessarily and are primarily just things with default CSS stylesheet rules. About 15 are "weak semantics about text, but meaningfully weak" - stuff like lists.  ~15 are sectioning or landmarks.  11 more are about tables - a 2 dimensional relationship of text.  14 are about forms. 2 are about "web components" using that term broadly as they aren't actually bound to custom elements - Templates and slots. And then two are... well... something else.  We'll come back to that. And ~30 are deprecated.
    </p>

    <p>The route to all of these elements was a little different - and they have different costs associated with them, and offer different value.  One thing that's interesting to note is that the majority of them are what Dave Rupert refers to as "Spicy Divs".  That is, there's not much to them - they aren't complex or interactive, and they don't bring a ton of real world value. That's not to say they are value-<em>less</em>, but ultimately we spend a lot of time and bandwidth in standards debating what often amount to silly things because of it.  &lt;main&gt; is a kind of a good example.  Nothing wrong with it as an element, it's great, in fact - it just has a long and complex backstory that ultimately cost a lot relative to its real world value and proven use.  Tons of time defining and debating address, which isn't really that meaningful to browsers, and then lots of evangelism telling people they're using it wrong - only in the end to eventually have to admit that it ultimately means the thing people used it as.</p>

    <p>The second thing to notice is that there there are <em>very few</em> interactive elements.  Further, most of the ones we usually talk about are about <em>forms</em>.  And that lead us to this: Interactive, form-related elements on the web are... tricky.</p>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">The form-related game</contextual-heading>
    <p>
      On the one hand, there's a lot to like about native, interactive form controls. In theory, they can
      bring a simple declarative form with all kinds of goodness in terms of platform integration, portability and centralized work on accessibility and UX.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Unfortunately...
    </p>

    <pre class="wargames">...primary goal has not yet been achieved
&gt; What is the primary goal?
To win the game.</pre>

    <p>More simply: Despite a lot of work, and huge investments, people still gravitate toward custom implmentations. That's not good for anybody.</p>

    <p><em>Why are native form controls are hard?</em></p>
    

    <p>Well... So many reasons, but to start with, they one that they could really do without is that they got off to a tricky start by design.</p>
      

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="3"><pre>&lt;input type="WOPR"&gt;</pre></contextual-heading>

    <p>
      <em>Most</em> of the form-related controls are created based on
      <code>&lt;input type-"..."&gt;</code>. You've probably heard someone suggest that
      this is great because in cases where it isn't supported, simply
      providing the text field is fine. However, this is incomplete and we've been paying the price for it for a long time.</p>

    <pre class="wargames">&gt; People sometimes make... mistakes.</pre>

    <p>Did you ever notice how the JavaScript API surface of input works differently based on the type?  If the type is number and you type gibberish that looks remotely 'potentially numbery' like '12312e314124', then <code>.value</code> will be '' (empty string).  Or, the checkbox type has a checked property, but that means that input type=number has that property too... What does it do? Anything!? Or, have you ever noticed how <code>.selectionStart</code> and <code>.selectionEnd</code> actually <em>throw</em> if you tried to use them on a numeric input type?!  If not, go have a watch of <a href="https://vimeo.com/144980655">Monica Dinculescu's <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> I ♡ you, but you're
        bringing me down</a> -- a 45 minute talk about <em>just this</em>.</p>

    <p> 
      Ultimately, many of these problems stem from us accepting the illusion presented that a date picker <em>is a</em> kind of text input.
    </p>

    <figure class="captioned-image optional">
      <img data-src="/media/10-wargames-falken.png" alt="Faulken pointing to NORAD screens">
      <figcaption>Stephen Falken: Uh, uh, General, what you see on these screens up here is a fantasy; a computer-enhanced hallucination. Those blips are not real missiles. They're phantoms.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Realistically, a date picker <em>isn't</em> a text input.  Perhaps at an HTTP level, or even a database level, it's just a value - but controls are about how to <em>populate</em> values, and that's quite a different thing. It's not an <em>is-a</em> relationship:  A date picker is a
      completely different complex control with potentially lots of complex interactions: Different things
      it needs to communicate, lots of sub-iteractions to manage, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>All of this is why you might hear people suggest "LSP" or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">"Favor composition over inheritance"</a> as a better alternative.</p>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="4">Acceptable Losses?</contextual-heading>
      <p>This is exacerbated by the fact that at the end of the day, developers are left with some pretty unappealing choices: Something is going to be sacrificed.</p>

      <p>
        Color pickers provide a great example of how this plays out in practice: Will developers building the sorts of tools that use a color picker allow a simple input field as the fallback until <em>every browser</em> ships something acceptable?  Seems like not much of a choice really.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sadly the story for 'polyfilling' an element also still isn't great: It's really just 'replacing it with something else entirely'.
        So, at the end of the day, you've got to go and find something that is a good quality stand in anyway.  Finally, since literally <em>everything your code relies on understanding them DOM</em>, and that stand in will have entirely <em>different</em> DOM, you now have two entirely different interactive trees to worry about. Yikes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Further, this situation isn't necessarily short lived, historically.  The reality is that lacking universal support can be the case for a long time: Native
        support for
        <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> was added to the last major
        browser... <em>Checks notes...</em> <strong>last year</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even after all of that... Guess what? It still isn't <em>acceptable</em>
        for a lot of people because it isn't styleable -- and in fact, it has entirely different UI and features everywhere. While this <em>can</em> occasionally be very useful on some kinds of devices, it makes things like providing helpful documentation hard.  Worse, even the native ones weren't super keyboard accessible either.
      </p>

      <p>
        So... That's a lot of barriers and disincentives.

      </p>

      <p>
        Conversely, a custom solution can solve all of these problems <em>now</em>... So it shouldn't actually be surprising that developers often
        choose a custom solution: There are no 'acceptable losses' for developers here - all of the choices are somehow bad.

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="4">Learn, dammit.</contextual-heading>
      <p>
        Now, let's talk about how we get out of this mess. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll be happy to know that there <em>are</em> efforts to both learn and
        improve existing native interactive elements. If you haven't seen Greg
        Whitworth and Nicole Sullivan's talk
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFvPLrKZywA">HTML Isn't Done</a> from
        Chrome Dev Summit last year, I would highly recommend it (below).
      </p>
    <figure class="captioned-image optional">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFvPLrKZywA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There's also been a heck of a lot of work to make it possible for authors to
      define their own interactive elements that work just like the native ones. The
      idea is to help empower developers to help explore the space and try to help
      find the really sweet spots that strike all of the right balances.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's worth pointing out <em>why</em> this is useful - it's not just an
      academic exercise that is trying to push responsibility to developers. It's
      important because the truth is: <em>We don't actually know how</em>. We
      need to be able to throw lots of things at the wall and see what sticks.
      The trouble is, currently (historically) failure is <em>really</em> slow and
      <em>really</em> expensive -- and even our most educated 'guesses' at
      improvement are still just that: Guesses. We haven't proved we have this
      figured out yet.

    <p>But let's flip the game around and talk about <em>non-form related interactive controls</em> - what does <em>that</em> game look like?</p>

    <section class="sectioning">

    <p>
      This is where things get really interesting to me - because a lot of components people really want <em>aren't</em> about forms at all.  And interestingly, realistically, we've come up with really only 1 strictly generic non-form-related UI control in 30 years: <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.
      We've had that supported universally since... <em>checks notes...</em>
      <strong>Jan 14, <em>2020</em></strong>. Again, it has most of the same kinds of general problems. In the most
      recent HTTP Almanac data, it was the 102nd most used HTML element... Can you
      even <em>name</em> 101 other HTML elements?
    </p>

    <p>So... This is terrible.</p>

    <p>
      Our continued problems in this space are part of the reason there is hesitancy
      to take up entirely <em>new</em> things... Like, tabs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in 2015, I managed to get a number of people in Web standards (especially
      a11y) interested in working on a possible new element proposal for HTML which
      would have given not only the tabset but some other things as
      well. Determined not to doomed by the same sorts of stylability
      problems, we set out to define things that would become shadow parts and
      themes and custom properties and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, in many ways, it wasn't great. Recently, this has got me to thinking:
      What if this isn't even the right game we're playing? What if for
      <em>some</em> elements at least - non-form associated ones - the right lesson take away is that this is an unnecessary exercise in futility?
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe we need a <em>different</em> kind of experiment: One that just says
      "Strange game. The only winning move is not to play".
    </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sectioning">
      <contextual-heading id="chess" role="heading" aria-level="5"><pre class="wargames">How about a nice game of chess?</pre></contextual-heading>
    <p>
      So, here's the basic idea: What if we just created a resilient pattern
      focused on mainly <em>function</em> and <em>meaning</em> -- and
      <em>hardly at all on the UI aspect</em>. What if instead of inventing complex
      new ways to strike the balance of preventing authors from styling too much, we
      mostly just acknowledged the fact that they want to, and... let them.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if, like with <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> you could kind of just take
      control of the UI, but... maybe without throwing it away entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spoke with Greg Whitworth about this, who has been investigating how to improve the existing controls on the Web(see also <a href="http://gwhitworth.com/blog/2019/10/can-we-please-style-select/)">Can we please style select?</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, he completely agreed with the overall premise. He went described how...</p>

    <blockquote>
      The core mission of Open UI, a new W3C community group, is to document the anatamoies, behaviors and states of components and controls from across frameworks. By doing this, we can ensure that the key pieces that folks don't want to re-create, they don't have to. We've got a few different ideas that are beginning to take shape but changes like this are like peeling an onion. If it's a new control/component then it would be a bit more straight forward but the most painful controls we've found have been on the web since the 90s. So we'll be gathering telemetry and ensuring that any modifications we ultimately propose are web compatible.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In our conversation we discussed how things like tabs seem like an interesting target where this kind of thing
      might just work really well. The particular shape of the tabs problem lends
      itself, I think, to easily trying something completely different and entirely without past baggage.</p>

    <p> 
      So, in that light 
      <a href="http://panel-set.glitch.me/">here's just such an experiment</a>
      which we think has some nice qualities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a declarative <em>decorator</em> over otherwise good but
        non-interactive semantics. That means there's no miss of differing
        interaction issues here caused by complex inheritance. It's <em>composition</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't change your light DOM, and it <em>barely</em> uses Shadow DOM.
        There's no "two trees" problem, and there's not secrets or new
        challenges. Go ahead, use CSS and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        It adds the function, keyboard handling, accessibility stuff and a simple
        container for you. That's it, really.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you really <em>want</em> to opt in to some simple 'default styles' that
        might be passible if you don't care too much and like the 'minor tweaks
        only' approach, it has an attribute that enables 'native' look and
        feel which might be enough for some people.
      </li> 
    </ul>

    <p>So... that's it. It could for sure use more work, but WDYT? Would you try it out?  Let us know your thoughts?  Such experiments will be useful in informing work and directions for efforts like Open-UI and possible future standards.</p>

    <p>Will it help?  To be honest, I don't know, but maybe the right way to learn involves trying something really different, and I'm open to anything...</p>
