	<p class="segue">
		Every now and then I see conversations that talk about 'HTML5' (as in the effort that led to our modern living standard HTML) and frequently in a light comparing 'what's changed'.  Very often, these celebrate new components that 'HTML5' added and I always want to add some context, so here are some notes.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Web is 30 years old this year, and I'd like to take a minute to add pespective that is potentially hard to appreciate...
	</p>

	<section class="sectioning">
		<contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">The first half</contextual-heading>

		<p>
			I expect that a lot of people writing for the Web now don't realize (or maybe some of us have now forgotten) that for roughly half of the Web's current lifetime - things were <em>woefully</em> incompatible by today's standards.
		</p>

		<p>
			What we think of as fairly basic things today -- like how the document parsed and what DOM it created, even things as basic as the idea <em>that the DOM was tree-shaped</em> wasn't a universal! In fact, the browser controlling 90+% of the market share didn't think so!  How events worked? Nope.  And those were just big obvious things, there were tons and tons of subtle but impossible differences.
		</p>

		<p>
			Simon Pieters has started writing a book about precisely this topic and his early <a href="https://htmlparser.info/introduction">intro chapter</a> contains many excellent insights and history explaining how almost as soon as they sat down to start the WHATWG specification, they realized that what they were really doing was actually trying to specify the parser and a myriad of magical underpinnings that were unspecified and frequently wildly incompatible that made moving foward nearly impossible.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="sectioning">
		<contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">Half?</contextual-heading>
		<p>
			On a timeline of the whole 30 year life of the Web, "HTML5" started about half way. That far in, HTML still hadn't come to terms with one of the initial decisions that Tim made: Was it SGML, or wasn't it? Here is one of my favorite quotes from the WHATWG specification
		</p>

		<blockquote>The resulting confusion — with validators claiming documents to have one representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably implemented a different representation — has wasted decades of productivity. This version of HTML thus returns to a non-SGML basis</blockquote>

		<p>
			I love this quote because it marks a kind of mental turning point in beginning to come (back, one could argue) to to reality and stress the importance of implementation concescensus and practical considerations.  I love it because it's not hyperbole.  Decades.  That's <em>really</em> how much time was burned on those particular discussions that most people will ultimately never even know happened.
		</p>

		<p>
			There was <em>deep</em> sunk financial and emotional investment in some of this stuff at that point - long efforts that began almost from the very first days of the Web... But at the end of the day it was largely disconnected from reality in ways that were ultimately unresolvable and this meant we couldn't move forward.  Convincing people to re-orient in a way that maybe even feels like the antithesis of all that works is, honestly, an amazing accomplishment all on its own.
		</p>
		<p>
			Actually specing all of that low-level stuff in ways that allowed us to move forward however, and getting the standards an interop withouth <em>any</em> new elements was a monumental accomplishment that remains under appreciated, and here's why: Most people will never know.  Unlike many features, this giant task simply yields things that are more or less fully invisible to authors.  You just don't have to worry about those things.  That kind of stuff is huge, but also easy to forget.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="sectioning">
		<contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">Features, in perspective</contextual-heading>
		<p>
			So, let's come back to the new features.  My view on them is complicated: Seasoned with perspective maybe.  It is possible to be simultaneously happy to have them and also believe that they are very imperfect, contain many regrettable decisions and believe that part of this is caused by the fact that how we got them was flawed.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Let me explain...
		</p>

		<p>
			When I say HTML5, was begun about halfway into the life of the Web, that's a very rough estimate.  In reality, much of it began earlier than we even think because a lot of what that effort wanted to do was to take seemingly good and fairly mature ideas from XML-land and bring them to HTML in a way that was compatible. Ian Hickson himself talks about work that began in late 2003, so let's arbitarily consider 2004 that as an inception point for many features.  If you researched, I'm sure you'd find it's earlier than that for many of them.  
		</p>

		<p>
		 	Many of the new input types, for example, came from XForms.  To some extent, sure, yay... There are good things here -- but it's not all remotely good smells if we're honest:  People are significantly unhappy with the inability to style them.  There are big inconsistencies across platforms in ways that really bug designers.  We can't seem to really nail the interactions in some kind of bad ways and some use cases don't fit neatly. All of this conspires to it still being a little bit of struggle to get people to use them.  Further, nearly everyone in standards agrees that, in retrospect, one input element with a magical type attribute that does 25 different things and causes confusing results and isn't uniform is not good.  All of these conspire to, even in 2019, them being underused and attempts to replace them with better answers from user space.
		 </p>

		 <p>But in many ways, that's kind of the best news.</p>

		 <p>There features that just failed along the way.</p>
		 <p>Still others have not fully arrived in all browsers to this day.  Consider that as of the last version of Edge as we know it, released on November of 2018 - we still technically don't a uniform implementation of summary/details, probably the simplest interactive element that can exist... And really, people don't seem to love it as much as you'd expect anyways for similar reasons as above.  
		</p>

		<p>More complex things like dialogs - well - honestly, we're still working on it.</p>

		<p>
			Audio and video were a kind of important thing to Ian Hickson and I think that some of his demos really probably helped 'sell' HTML5, but I'm going to say something unconventional on these too...
		</p>

		<p>  
			At least as of a year or so ago, you could not, in fact, rely on natively accessible video controls - and the inability to style and brand meant that to this day custom controls are huge.  It seems that in many ways, the "real" value we have shown here is largely that we can separate the two enough that it plausible to do so without plugins and extensions for actually doing the streaming and so on.
		</p>

		<p>There were also two embedded formats, SVG and MathML.  In 2019 we are still working on getting the later across the finish line.
		</p>

			
		<p>
			Many of the remaining elements that are not interactive, have something else in common though: There's hardly anything to them.  May are simply 'barely sugar' over CSS and ARIA properties that already existed.  
		</p>

		<p>
			For example: The &lt;main&gt; element.  ARIA had <code>role=main</code> already.  This came up very very many times that there should just be a tag.  Discussions went on for years, until finally, main was added to the spec... In a way that included advice contrary to that of <code>role=main</code>, and, until everyone had it implemented, you had to do it manually ala <code>main role="main"</code> and also add the equivalent UA stylesheet role.  So, for a time, it was the opposite of sugar.  That was finally resolved... last year?
		</p>


		<p>
			Look, I'm not trying to be negative on any of this, I'm simply suggesting that standardization is hard.  Ian Hickson once estimated that HTML would take 19 years.  I'm not suggesting "don't love features".  I love features too.  I'm suggesting that you consider the "real time" that they took and what we got for that.
		</p>

		<p>
			The next time "big features" start landing and you're tempted to think "wow that's fast" I can almost entirely assure you that it wasn't.  I've heard people recollect "flexbox and grid happened fast".  Did they though? The first discussion of the flexible box model was in 2004. When did we finally get unprefixed, interoperable implementations in all of the browsers?  Roughly a decade, I think.  Grid's history is even longer.  </p>
	</section>
	<section class="sectioning">
		<contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">The Extensible Web</contextual-heading>
		<p>
			Am I happy we have things like flexbox and grid? <em>Hells yes</em>, in fact, knowing what that actually took makes me appreciate them even more.  I'm even happy that we have all of the other elements and features, despite their many imperfections.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the same time I can't help but look at that, and data about their use after all of that, and what people say about them and think that this neededn't be a pattern we repeat and that we can do better. That's why we wrote the Extensible Web Manifesto.


			 in mid-2013.  It wasn't like the face of standards changed on that day.  In late 2014 I made the case for thinking about how we incorporate and adapt how we do standards in the face of this new philosophy to the W3C.  So, realistically, I would say that we have spent 4 years attempting to begin to rethink how we approach things.
		</p>
		<p>
			In that time, we've got an interoperable spec for and API for URLs, we got fetch, we got important custom elements related stuff, we got custom properties, we got Houdini - which, all by itself, the fact that that is even a conversation that we are seriously willing to have feels like an unimaginably big win, and things are starting to fall in place as fundamental bits happen -- we are talking about built in modules!!  And yes, it all means we are grappling with hard new problems, but I guess what I am trying to say is:  If on the same day we published the Extensible Web Manifesto, we picked new features and began the work... Do you think we would have them now, and they would be good? I don't.  But I do believe that we're on the right track.
