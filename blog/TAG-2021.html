  <h1 class="contextual-heading">TAG 2021</h1>
  <p class="segue">The W3C is in the middle of a big, and arguably very difficult election for the W3C Techincal Architecture Group (aka TAG).  The TAG is one of two small bodies within the W3C which are <em>elected</em> by membership.  If you're unfamilliar with this, I wrote this exceptionally brief <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/W3CPrimer.html">Primer for Busy People</a>.  I'd like to tell you why I think this is a big election, why it is complex, what I (parsonally) think about it, and what you can do if you agree.</p>

<p>
The current W3C TAG election is both important and complex for several reasons.  It's big because 4 of the 6 elected seats are up for election and two exceptional members (Alice Boxhall from Google and David Baron from Mozilla) are unable to run for reelection. It's big because there are) <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/12/07-tag-nominations">nine candidates</a> and each brings different things to the table (and statements don't always capture enough). It's complex because of the voting system and participation.</p>

<p>Let me share thoughts on what I think would be a good result, and then I'll explain why that's hard to achieve and what I think we need to avoid.</p>

<section class="sectioning">
  <h2 class="contextual-heading">A good result...</h2>

  <p>I believe the best result involves 3 candidates for sure (listed alphabetically):  Lea Verou, Sangwhan Moon and Theresa O’Connor.</p>

  <p>Let's start with the incumbents.  I fully support re-electing both Theresa O’Connor and Sangwhan Moon and cannot imagine reasons not to.  Both have a history in standards, have served well on TAG, have a diversity of knowledge, and are very reasonable and able to work well.  Re-electing some good incumbents with these qualities is a practical advantage to the TAG as well as they are already well immersed.  These are easy choices.</p>

  <p>Lea Verou is another easy choice for me.  Lea brings a really diverse background, set of perspectives and skills to the table.  She's worked for the W3C, she's a great communicator to developers (this is definitely a great skill in TAG whose outreach is important), she's worked with small teams, produced a number of popular libraries and helped drive some interesting standards. The OpenJS Foundation was pleased to nominate her, but Frontiers and several others were also supportive.  Lea also deserves "high marks".</p>

  <p>These 3 are also a happily diverse group.</p>

  <p>This leaves one seat.  There are 3 other candidates who I think would be good, for different reasons: Martin Thompson, Amy Guy and Jeffrey Yaskin.  Each of them will bring something different to the table and if I am really honest, it is a hard choice. I wish we could seat all 3 of them, but we can't.  At least in this election (that is, they can run again).</p>

  <p>For brevity, I will not even attempt to make all the cases here, but I encourage you to read their statements and ask friends. Truth be told, I have a strong sense that "any mix of these 6 could be fine" and different mixes optimize for slightly different things. Also, as I will explain, there are some things that seem slightly more important to me than who I recommend is third best vs fourth or fifth...</p>

<section style="margin: 1rem; padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid gray;" class="sectioning">
  <h2 class="contextual-heading">TLDR; Turn out the vote</h2>
  <p><em>If you find yourself in agreement with me, more or less, I would suggest: "place the 3 I mentioned above (Lea, Tess, Sangwhan) at least your top 4 places", pick a fourth from my other list and put them in whatever order you like.</em>.</p>

  <p>If you're a W3C member, your AC Representative votes for you -- tell them.  Make sure they vote - the best result definitely depends on higher than average turnout.  Suprisingly, about 75% of membership <em>doesn't normally vote</em>.  These elections are among the rare times when there are "votes" where there are equal voices.  A tiny 1 person member org has exactly the same voting power as every mega company. </p>

  <p>If you're not a W3C member, you don't have a way to vote directly but you <em>can</em> publicly state your support and tag in member orgs or reach out to people you know who work for member orgs.  Historically this has definitely helped - let's keep W3C working well!</p>

<section class="sectioning">
  <h2 class="contextual-heading">STV, Turnout and Negative Preference</h2>
  <p>I don't like arguing <em>against</em> candidates or organizations.  These are all, in my personal experience, good people - even the ones I disagree with - who are genuinely trying to do good.</p>

  <p>That said, it's helpful for illustrating why turnout matters a lot to preventing undesirable outcomes if you can say what you think is a negative outcome, so let's lay one out...</p>

  <section class="sectioning">
    <h3 class="contextual-heading">Negative Preference</h3>

    <p>Granting every possible benefit of the doubt as to what they are <em>really</em> trying to say or achieve by taking positions against most modern privacy efforts, I just think the way that IAB's representation has chosen to approach things in the W3C isn't positive. Everything else aside, if I am honest, I have a <em>negative</em> preference for their candidate because of it.</p>

    <p>They have been extraordinarily vocal (and profilic) in emails and opening GitHub issues, putting a lot of emphasis on portraying things in a way that I feel have been unhelpful.</p>

    <p>They have opened issues citing, for example, that more privacy (https) is bad for the environment.  They have argued that they are the "real" defenders of the open web. They have argued that recent privacy actions are bad for small businesses.  They claim that many things in W3C, even documents like <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/security-questionnaire">a security questionaire</a> are, essentially, violations of anti-trust, and that by closing an issue you are somehow complicit in illegal activities, that W3C should be actively censoring or preventing shipping somehow.</p>

    <p>"Why do you hate the environment" or "why do you hate the open web" are inherently sort of unproductive ways to lead, even if you genuinely believe there is something worth discussing.  The W3C is a <em>voluntary</em> standards organization.  It has no means or powers to compel work from any member, demand implementation or conformance or prevent UAs from doing anything.  The W3C is a place where we can voluntarily come together and attempt to optimize work and concensus and be heard and, if we did a good job, ultimately hope that other companies will implement, ship and maintain an interoperable and predictable thing free of IP/royalty worries. It is also not the only voluntary standards body in which they can do that.</p> 

    <p>If there are concerns (there may well be), which are within the W3C's real purview (there may be), that we would like to see addressed, and can be addressed, this just doesn't seem to me the best way to effect change.  Effectively, I worry that putting them on TAG could be actively unproductive if these are indicative of the discussions.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="sectioning"> 
    <h3 class="contextual-heading">Why order and turnout matter...</h3>
    <p>STV, the voting system used by the W3C stands for "Single Transferrable Vote". "Single" is the key work - it means that only 1 of those preferences will ultimately actually be counted. The basic criteria involves a quota - if you reach the quota, you get a seat.  The means of counting is fairly complicated, but the simpler implication is that it is much more likely to be one toward the <em>top</em> of your list.</p>
    <p>As a hypothetical, imagine that most of the W3C's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">438 member organizations</a> fully agreed with this post, it's negative and positive preferences: Very great agreement of preference that 6 of 9 are who we actively prefer, by a lot - that 3 of them we very much think should be there, and that we'd sort of actively not want one.</p>

    <p>If turnout is low (it historically is, and this is overlapping holidays), this means a very small number of organizations can show up and put our least preferred candidate as their #1. The net result is that they reach the quota easily, while even the 3 universally appealable candidates stuggle with simple ordering issues.</p>

    <p>This is the inherent weakness, in my mind of STV.  STV optimizes for seating a critically sized, but vocal minority.  The trouble is that turnout greatly exacerbates here.  The <em>only</em> way I can see STV not yielding bad outcomes (whether my preferences are one are not) is to have <em>good turnout</em>. This raises the quota, prevents takeovers and makes a more generally acceptable slate more likely.  In short: It seems much better for the W3C at large if more people vote.  Please vote.</p>
