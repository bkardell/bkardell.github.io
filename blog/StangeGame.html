    <p class="segue">This is part of a series about making the browser speak and listen to speech.  In my last post <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/Greetings-Professor-Falken.html">Greetings, Professor Falken: Web Speech APIs Part I</a>, I talked about the existing APIs we "have" for speaking (as well as why the air quotes) and all the many ways that they are wonky today.  In this post I'll share some of my own opinions on that API, as well as how I'm dealing with the <em>speaking</em> part IRL.</p>

    <p>Let's talk about native HTML elements and interesting challenges...</p>

    <p>Interactive elements on the web are... tricky.</p>

    <p>
      On the one hand, in theory there's a lot to like about them. They can
      bring a simple declarative form with all kinds of goodness in platform
      integration, portability and centralized work on accessibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sadly though, most of this isn't self-evident: It takes some time and
      education to be able to appreciate a lot of it. On the other hand, a whole lot
      of the surface level stuff that <em>is highly observable</em> is kind of
      awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then there's also some problematic history...
    </p>

    <h2>Historical challenge: The primary goal</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Many</em> of HTML's most interesting interactive elements are form
      related. However, there are an astonishing few <em>elements</em> because many
      of the controls are created based on
      <code>&lt;input type-"..."&gt;</code> - this pattern was built into
      the web around HTTP interfaces. You've probably heard someone suggest that
      that's great because in cases where it isn't supported, simply
      providing the text field is fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this suggestion is oversold. This isn't the only way to arrive at
      that outcome, and this particulat approach is problematic for a lot of
      reasons. If you're interesting in some history and developer-based reasons
      why
      <a href="https://meowni.ca/posts/a-story-about-input/">Monica Dinculescu's <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> I ♡ you, but you're
        bringing me down</a>
      is a great read. Many of these problems are created by accepting the illusion
      presented to you that a date picker is a kind of text input. Because, of
      course, it isn't. This general kind of problem why we say "consider
      composition over inheritance."
    </p>

    <p>
      A date picker <em>isn't</em> a text input. Realistically, it's a
      completely different complex control with potentially lots of different things
      to communicate, and lots of sub-iteractions to manage. Sure, internally, way
      down low, it might ultimately put that data into an internal text field.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's terrible enough , but many of the details that developers actually have
      to deal with here only get worse...
    </p>

    <h2>All the actual choices are bad</h2>

    <p>
      A text input often <em>isn't</em> an acceptable fallback for many real
      cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Color picker is a great example of the challenges we face here: Most of the
      use cases that require a color picker can't practically accept a simple
      input field as a good alternative UI. However, until <em>everyone</em> ships
      something acceptable, that's realistically the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why? Because, sadly 'polyfilling' an element is, today, really just
      'replacing it with something else entirely'. That sucks because
      literally <em>everything your code relies on understanding them DOM</em>. If
      you only change the DOM <em>sometimes</em>, now you have two different
      interactive trees to worry about. Yikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Worse, the reality is that this can be the case for a long time: Native
      support for
      <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> was added to the last major
      browser... <em>Checks notes...</em> <strong>last year</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And even after all of that... Guess what? It still isn't <em>acceptable</em>
      for a lot of people. It isn't styleable. It has entirely different UI and
      features everywhere. While this can occasionally be useful on some kinds of
      devices, it makes things like helpful documentation hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Worse still, some of them (the native ones I mean) weren't keyboard
      accessible either.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, a custom solution can solve all of these problems <em>now</em>,
      in one way. Given all of this, it is not so surprising that developers often
      choose a custom solution: All of the choices are somehow bad.
    </p>

    <h2>Learn, goddammit.</h2>

    <p>
      You'll be happy to know that there <em>are</em> efforts to both learn and
      improve existing native interactive elements. If you haven't seen Greg
      Whitworth and Nicole Sullivan's talk
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFvPLrKZywA">HTML Isn't Done</a> from
      Chrome Dev Summit last year, I would highly recommend it (below).
    </p>

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZFvPLrKZywA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    <p>
      There's also been a heck of a lot of work to make it possible for authors to
      define their own interactive elements that work just like the native ones. The
      idea is to help empower developers to help explore the space and try to help
      find the really sweet spots that strike all of the right balances.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's worth pointing out <em>why</em> this is useful - it's not just an
      academic exersize that is trying to push responsibility to developers. It's
      important because the truth is: <em>We don't actually know how</em>. We
      need to be able to throw lots of things at the wall and see what sticks: We
      learn a lot through failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      The trouble is, currently (historically) failure is <em>really</em> slow and
      <em>really</em> expensive -- and even our most educated 'guesses' at
      improvement are still just that: Guesses. We haven't proved we have this
      figured out yet.
    </p>

    <h2 id="different">Would you like to play a game?</h2>

    <p>
      Realistically, we've come up with precisely 1 strictly generic
      non-form-related UI control in 30 years: <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>.
      We've had that supported universally since... <em>checks notes...</em>
      <strong>Jan 14, <em>2020</em></strong>. Again, it has most of the same kinds of general problems. In the most
      recent HTTP Almanac data, it was the 102nd most used HTML element... Can you
      even <em>name</em> 101 other HTML elements?
    </p>

    <p>So... This is terrible.</p>

    <p>
      Our continued problems in this space are part of the reason there is hesitancy
      to take up entirely <em>new</em> things... Like, tabs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Back in 2015, I managed to get a number of people in Web standards (especially
      a11y) interested in working on a possible new element proposal for HTML which
      would have which would have given not only the tabset but some other things as
      well. Determined not let this be doomed by the same sorts of stylability
      problems, we set out to define things that would become shadow parts and
      themes and custom properties and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, in many ways, it wasn't great. Recently, this has got me to thinking:
      What if this isn't even the right game we're playing? What if for
      <em>some</em> elements at least, this is a unnecessary exercise in futility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe we need a <em>different</em> kind of experiment: One that just says
      "Strange game. The only winning move is not to play".
    </p>

    <h2>How about a nice game of chess?</h2>

    <p>
      So, here's the basic idea: What if we just created a resilient pattern
      focused on mainly <em>function</em> and <em>meaning</em> -- and
      <em>hardly at all on the UI aspect</em>. What if instead of inventing complex
      new ways to strike the balance of preventing authors from styling too much, we
      mostly just acknowledged the fact that they want to, and... let them.
    </p>

    <p>
      What if, like with <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> you could kind of just take
      control of the UI, but... maybe without throwing it away entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spoke with Greg Whitworth about this, who has been investigating how to improve the existing controls on the Web(see also <a href="http://gwhitworth.com/blog/2019/10/can-we-please-style-select/)">Can we please style select?</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, he completely agreed with the overall premise. He went described how...</p>

    <blockquote>
      The core mission of Open UI, a new W3C community group, is to document the anatamoies, behaviors and states of components and controls from across frameworks. By doing this, we can ensure that the key pieces that folks don't want to re-create, they don't have to. We've got a few different ideas that are beginning to take shape but changes like this are like peeling an onion. If it's a new control/component then it would be a bit more straight forward but the most painful controls we've found have been on the web since the 90s. So we'll be gathering telemetry and ensuring that any modifications we ultimately propose are web compatible.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In our conversation we discussed how things like tabs seem like an interesting target where this kind of thing
      might just work really well. The particular shape of the tabs problem lends
      itself, I think, to easily trying something completely different and entirely without past baggage.</p>

    <p> 
      So, in that light 
      <a href="http://panel-set.glitch.me/">here's just such an experiment</a>
      which we think has some nice qualities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a declarative <em>decorator</em> over otherwise good but
        non-interactive semantics. That means there's no miss of differing
        interaction issues here caused by complex inheritance.
      </li>
      <li>
        It doesn't change your light DOM, and it <em>barely</em> uses Shadow DOM.
        There's no "two trees" problem, and there's not secrets or new
        challenges. Go ahead, use CSS and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        It adds the function, keyboard handling, accessibility stuff and a simple
        container for you. That's it, really.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you really <em>want</em> to opt in to some simple 'default styles' that
        might be passible if you don't care too much and like the 'minor tweaks
        only' approach, it has an attribute that enables 'native' look and
        feel which might be enough for some people.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>So... that's it. It could for sure use more work, but WDYT? Would you try it out?  Let us know your thoughts?  Such experiments will be useful in informing work and directions for efforts like Open-UI and possible future standards.</p>
