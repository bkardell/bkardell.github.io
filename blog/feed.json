Wow! What this tells me is that there are a <em>lot</em> of dasherized tags in use.</p>\n    <p>It important to note that that doesn‚Äôt mean these are ‚Äúcustom elements‚Äù proper, but it also doesn‚Äôt really matter: What we care about really, is what you were trying to say there, semantically.</p>\n    <p>Of these, there are 3,227 different unique prefixes. These may or may not indicate common authors, but they might at least be a helpful way to look for popular ‚Äòsets‚Äô of elements. For example, it‚Äôs unsuprising to see the <code>amp-</code> prefix in there\n      given all of the boosts that it gets, and it‚Äôs nice to see them all linked in and counted there. I‚Äôve organized <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bkardell/efdebc65fc096e25916a8874ee0a4c33\">a json output that looks like this</a></p>  \n    <p>To break them down into some further semi-arbitrary groups for summary:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>~7.8k of these occur between 1 and 100 times.</li>\n      <li>31 of these occur between 101-200 times</li>\n      <li>14 occur between 200-500 times</li>\n      <li>4 occur between 500-1000 times</li>\n      <li>4 occur &gt; 500 times</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p>One personal note: I‚Äôm kind of sad to see that the most popular one is <code>amp-auto-ads</code> occuring a whopping 3718 times and it‚Äôs not remotely the only thing that would appear to be about ads. In fact, <code>amp-ad</code> also occurs 395 times and there are many\n      other non-amp elements that appear to be ad related. But... I guess the web has a lot of ads. Who knew.</p>\n    <p>More importantly, it‚Äôs interesting to look at this file from the bottom up (or the grouped one) though and think about whether we can identify the possible sources of these, or ‚Äòtag‚Äô them according to common purposes somehow. I‚Äôd like to think about how we could get this into a format thatIf\n      you feel like you‚Äôre potentially interested in digging in and helping think about this, identifying where some of those come from, what their purpose is, etc, getting that data into a a place where we can do that kind of stuff better ‚Äì whatever, feel\n      free to leave comments on any of these gists or cc me (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/briankardell\">@briankardell</a>) on twitter.</p>\n    \n",

This past week some things happened which I think make for an interesting review and some thought about whether we did the right things, and how we can do better.  \n\t</p>\n\t<script src=\"../prism.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../prism.css\">\n   \n\t\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThis week, the CSS Working Group tweeted an informal Twitter poll that looked like this (below) - if you haven't voted or replied to it yet, I would ask that you read this before you do:\n\t</p>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Poll about naming a new CSS function that coerces/concatenates strings:<br><br>.bar-graph {<br> --size: 50%;<br> height: var(--size);<br> content: NAME(var(--size));<br>}<br>.icon {<br> --icon-id: 23;<br> background: url(NAME(\"/assets/icon-\", var(--icon-id), \".svg\"));<br>}<br><br>NAME = ?</p>‚Äî üíñTaudry Hepburnüíñ (@tabatkins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tabatkins/status/1100838423248551936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\t<p> \n\t\tIt includes two examples attempting to show a couple of hypothetical uses of a new function in CSS that coerces/concatenates strings and asks what authors what they expect it would be called, offering the following choices in the poll:\n\t</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><code>text()</code></li>\n\t\t<li><code>concat()</code></li>\n\t\t<li><code>to-string()</code></li>\n\t\t<li><code>Other (respond in thread)</code></li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tA not insignificant number of folks, some friends and standards people themselves were kind of appalled that <code>string()</code> wasn't in the list.  I mean... Of course it should be <code>string()</code>, right?  Hurriedly, some of us tried to provide some context but I feel like it really deserves some more words and it has me thinking more about how we can do better (and what that would even mean). \n\t</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Backstory</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tCSS doesn‚Äôt (currently) really \"do\" string concatenation \"generally\".  However, it now has constructs like CSS Custom Properties which seem to make this sort of thing very desirable. Based on some feedback and discussions <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/542\">an issue was opened in late 2016 by Lea Verou</a> to consider how to make that work. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p class=\"note\">\n\t\t\tNote: Yes, it is now 2019 and while this seems to many of us like a really long time for such a small, basic thing, in standards time, that is nothing.  The CSS Working Group has hundreds of issues of all shapes and sizes and doesn‚Äôt get to actually prioritize anyone‚Äôs actual time (some priorities are set by the company that employs you, and some of us do this in our \"spare\" time), and... sometimes there are non-immediately obvious complexities.  More on all that later.\n\t\t</p> \n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t In it, she points out that <code>content:</code> currently does a fairly simple form of concatination.  If you are unfamilliar with this, allow me to use Lea's Prism to illustrate it with an example from MDN below:\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<pre><code class=\"language-css\">a::after {\n  content: \" (\" attr(id) \")\";\n}\n</code></pre>\t\t\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tGreat.  She suggests that perhaps for a few other \"stringy\" properties, we should just do that - just make it able to smash those things together into one string.  That would be \"best\" for authors - less \"Lispy\" and easier to read (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\">Lisp family of languages</a> are somewhat famous for its use of lots of parenthesis and how it is read)\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tBut... authors want this ability in a lot of contexts where it isn't so simple or obvious.  Having a general thing which gets authors more power, in more places, sooner, also seems good for authors.  So, let's start there - powers first, maybe sugar later.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWithout going any further, I'd like to point out that this is a decision - a weighing of values of outcomes.  It means that if/when these powers ship, they will be kinda \"Lispy\".  Some authors, lacking the context as to why might that decision was made, might just think that this was a bad decision.  Even <em>with</em> that context, some authors would disagree with the choice.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnywho.. Discussions progressed about which use cases and constraints there were around a way to say ‚Äúsmash these two things together‚Äù as strings and one of the early names proposed for this was ‚Äústring()‚Äù.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>  \n\t\t\tSure, makes sense to me. Don't all programmers know string?  Seems pretty universal.  What else would it be even?  <em>Obviously</em> it should be string.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWell, here too, it seems that context matters a lot, in more ways than one.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt turns out that another spec <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/#using-named-strings\">CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module (GCPM)</a> has already defined a function called <code>string()</code> and does... not this.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tStill, a lot of us (yes, me too) are sort of like \"Yo wait... what?  what's that spec?  No browser seems to implement it -maybe we could just change that?  Surely this is a better use of string()?  Seems last updated in 2014, and if no one has implemented it, it's probably dead.  This is like... clearly a string, it feels bad that we can't use string for dumb reasons.\"\"\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tYes, all of that is mostly true, and... these things are also true:\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe ideas and work of GCPM, like a lot in CSS, have a long  history.  Bert Bos (one of the creators of CSS) made the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Jun/0042.html\">announcement on the mailing list</a> of its first working draft with that title in 2006.  In it, he said:\n\n\t\t</p><blockquote>It describes features typically only used when printing: running headers \nand footers, footnotes, references to page numbers, floats to the top \nand bottom of a page, etc.\n\nIndeed, we may define explicitly that these features *don't* work in \ninteractive media. (Although I already heard people ask for footnotes \nto work interactively as well, possibly as a light-weight form of \nhyperlink, opening a pop-up.)\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn fact, in many ways the ideas of both markup documents and stylesheets originated with print, not screens and a lot of people continued to see that potential of stylesheets to be important way beyond Web browsers.  The editor of that spec was H√•kon Wium Lie, the other creator of CSS.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, part of that is to point out that in the context of framing this, they wanted this concept of, well, kind of named strings and then a way to refer to and use those strings.  Strings, strings, strings, and so, well, <code>string()</code> seemed like a perfectly rational name.  I mean... Obviously it is a string.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen, as you might expect, people from those industries began implementing non-browser implementations.  Several supported string, some \"forever\" by the time this 2014 spec was published.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBut, Brian... This is all stuff doesn't work in <em>browsers</em>. It's for <em>print</em> and it seems almost like Bert was suggesting it might be kinda good to split them?  Let's just split them because this is <em>obviously</em> a string!\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tMaybe... but there is also this:\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn between the birth of CSS and now, we've also increasingly popularized this \"not print really\" but also \"not currently web browsers\" uncanny valley that are things like PDFs or EBooks.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThese have to work on various... er... screens. With different sizes and orientations and now can even be interactive.  You know, kind of like a web browser.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAt the same time, Web browsers have evolved too: \n\t\t\tIdeas like Web Packaging address, in a more general way, ideas in publishing around, for example, distributing an ebook.  Ideas like ServiceWorkers make it possible to now take that offline. You know, kind of like an ebook.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>  \n\t\t\tAnd so on.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd so, as much as possible, to common ends, we are all try to work together within the W3C, and especially in CSS.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>  \n\t\t\tCSS has never (to the best of my knowledge) overloaded an existing function with a radically different signature/meaning depending on the media.  To do so would certainly mean just agreeing that we would never adopt this, which, meh, I don't know?  In any case, for at least <em>some</em> authors who have to deal with both it might be really confusing... None of that seems \"great\" if it is all easily avoided.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tExcept, dammit, I am going to be honest: this really feels like a <code>string()</code> to me.  How can it not be?  That is definitely the best one.\n\t\t</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Resolving and Bikesheds</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnd so, all that back story set: There were discussions on this in the face to face meaning.  In this context, it seemed we had pretty general agreement on the use cases and how it would work, but we didn't have a name.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tHowever, there were a few ‚Äòfinalist‚Äô suggestions and cogent arguments about why some other names were actually <em>better</em> than <code>string()</code>.  Hmm... maybe?\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t \tIn the end, weighing all of the things, I think that we just decided it was probably best to just take <code>string()</code> off the table if there was something else that could work -- and people were even making compelling arguments that not only would they work - they were actually <em>better</em>.  Meh. I dunno. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt seemed that the really serious contenders were ‚Äúconcat()‚Äù and ‚Äútext()‚Äù and at some point I think people were just trying to move on and it seemed to be settling around <code>text()</code>.  The chair asked ‚ÄúAny objections to <code>text()</code>?‚Äù \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI squirmed. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tThere I really don't want to be \"keep the dumb bikeshed going guy\" (if you are not familliar with the term, here's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality#Argument\">an explanation of bikeshedding</a>).  I was at this point entirely willing to accept \"not <code>string()</code>\" but I just found text actually confusing and thought that most of the same problems of \"looks good in this light... as well as many others\" might apply here... But, you know... maybe that's just me?  Should I say something?\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo I finally chimed in and offered simply ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a better suggestion, but text() is not very clear to me‚Ä¶ There are so many ways that I could interpret ‚Äútext‚Äù in the context of CSS‚Äù and \"sorry\".  \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt wasn‚Äôt a formal objection, I just wanted to see if maybe others felt the similarly.  And, well... some did.  And... some didn't.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t Everyone, including me, seemed pretty sure that other people would surely find a thing either more intuitive, or actively unintuitive and we didn't agree on what those were.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tThis is a hard problem, because I think we all sometimes think that other people will surely see it 'like us'.  It's very hard to do otherwise.  But, people are diverse. CSS is used by people from many backgrounds, with many perspectives, different primary languages, cultures and so on and, really, it's just very hard to know.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThere was some more discussion.  There were a few other suggestions made (some minuted, some not, some serious, some not).  One idea that seemed to be perhaps popular was something vaguely ‚Äúlike string, but not exactly string‚Äù.  Any of these felt kind of more intuitive to me - but again, that's <em>just</em> me.  I could imagine even that perhaps \"more different\" was actually potentially less confusing to potential future developers?  I don‚Äôt know, honestly.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t  \tBut, deep down, I just kind of secretly wish it could be <code>string()</code> because that's the one I just know everyone would get.  Dammit.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAll this said, I would like to put this in some actual perspective:  No one was remotely cross about any of this.  It was not a heated argument.  Everyone was perfectly aimiable and all of the rationales were, I believe, entirely 'teachable'.  I believe that all parties agreed that we would celebrate getting this power interoperably implemented regardless of which one it wound up being.  \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tUnfortunately this meant that all we could agree to regarding the name was that we couldn't decide today.  Yeah, idk, maybe that's on me.  I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tRegardless, because there were good points and different perspectives all around, and because developers have even broader perspectives than the folks in that room - we thought that perhaps <em>asking</em> developers for input would help us clarify our thoughts, so Tab put together a poll.\n\t\t</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Optimization Problem Problems</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThe thing is, the most interesting thing in this poll to me is just how many actual users of CSS thought <code>concat()</code> was actually the best one, even without all of this context, and how few chose all of the others.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>  \n\t\t\tRealistically, text() is the only 100% clear, readable, requires no context alternative in that poll and yet, as it currently stands, a mere 1 in 5 people chose it. \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tUnfortunately <code>to-string()</code> was just one of several possible 'almost strings' and several people who chose other also said something string or string-like -- but... even still - it's not that many actually.  My manual efforts to tally them up as well as I can still seem to indicate that <code>concat()</code> has still way more support than all of the others combined.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt honestly wouldn't have been my guess going into all this.   But... really, the more I look at it... maybe that <em>is</em> better, even without all the context.  That is exactly what this function does. \n\t\t</p> \n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAnyways.. I think that it is impossible to optimize something like ‚Äúintuitiveness‚Äù without actual input from developers themselves and the really tough thing here is that there is that at best it is still merely optimization.  There is no clearly defined 'perfect' that will make everyone happy, especially without context or being heard.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs I have argued before, I also believe that we really haven‚Äôt figured out how to do that well yet.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn order to give good input, any of us require <em>at least</em> a good framing of context. That's hard because, often there is a lot and it's hard to know what matters and what doesn't.  The higher the \"tax\" of participating, the less likely it is that we will even get a good sampling of average users. Our time is just pulled in too many directions.  It takes 2 seconds to read the poll and vote, many minutes to read this post.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tFurther, to give really quality feedback and input, probably you need the ability to ask some questions or something.  But, even then: even if you sink in time and ask questions, the truth is, it is impossibly difficult to really weigh vapor.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That is, until we really sit down to use things, get some actual experience with it, try to apply it, stretch it, pull it, live with it a while and so on‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ really hard to say.  This is part of why I have advocated for the Extensible Web and Houdini work, and, why I argue that it is important to:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">Be able to fail, adapt and remix ideas along the way</a></li>\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@briankardell/web-standards-we-want-part-i-chapters-ca71985bf914\">Improve the economics</a> of this feedback loop and participation for developers so that there is more immediate value in their participation</li>\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Crisis.html\">Figure out how to incorporate all of this into the standards process in a really healthy way.</a></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<p>I feel like we‚Äôre making progress on all of these fronts, but I think we still have a very long way to go.  Things like Custom Functions, for example, might go a long way toward answering future questions of similar ilk.  It might be very plausible to get value quickly and have it compete and fail and adapt and grow and, maybe settle in in some ground we haven't quite defined yet that is \"not part of CSS proper\" but \"widely used in publishing\".  I don't know.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tI am very happy to say (and will probably write about) the fact that Houdini had some really good discussion in these meetings and, actually, I'm very pleasantly suprised by who I heard arguing what. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So... that's where we are, how we got there and some of the problems... How can we manage all of this better?

(note: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/\">Stranger than Fiction</a> is a movie about a very competant and number-obsessed  accountant named Harold Crick who suddenly begins to hear his life being narrated, and learns that a seemingly innocuous event one Wednesday will ultimately change his life and lead to his demise, and what happens next).\n\t</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<em>Narrator:</em>  This is the story of <strike>Harold Crick</strike> MathML... \n\t</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tWhen Tim Berners-Lee created HTML, he drew the original elements from the corpus of SGML documents on hand at CERN. Tim picked the most <em>common</em> ones that he found as the original set.  They are, effectively, semantics about text itself - and even in that, not necessarily especially good ones.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tGiven this, it is perhaps not surprising that almost immediately after its creation, discussions began arguing about what <em>other</em> tags should become part of HTML.\n\t</p>\n\t<p> \n\t\tSince the Web was originally pitched as an idea about sharing information among researchers, particularly at CERN, it is probably also not surprising that two gaps that came up very quickly were \"graphics\" and \"math\":  Researchers frequently need both.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tWithin a very short window of time, Dave Ragget had assemebled a number of ideas for what he called \"HTML+\" which took (believe it or not) only a fraction of those ideas and <em>would have created roughly five times as many elements as Tim's original browser supported.</em>\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tNotably among those, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_45.html\">Section 12 of HTML+  included a <code tag-esc=\"\">math</code> element</a> and they had experimental browser support at CERN.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/htmlplus_paper/math2.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\t\tA screenshot of the experimental browser at CERN rendering the proposed <code tag-esc=\"\">math</code> element in 1993.\n\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThat proposal wasn't accepted.  But it wasn't the end of the conversation, or the need, either.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">For many years</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t  And so, for many years, two communities continued to work on these problems outside of HTML itself: In the case of graphics this would become SVG, and in the case of formulae, MathML.  \n\t\t</p> \n\n\t\t<blockquote>Narrator: <strike>Harold Crick was a man</strike> MathML was a markup of infinite numbers, endless calculations, and remarkably few words. </blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>   \n\t\t\tLittle by little, bit by bit, they made progress.  By the time the WHATWG/HTML5 era rolled along, there was some degree of maturity and the new standard would come to include at least some degree of answer for both of these asks by reference to the work that these communities did.  HTML's section on <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content-other.html\">Other Embedded Content</a> mentions only two - these two, specifically.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIf you are unfamilliar with MathML, it looks something like this.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t <pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"&gt;\n  &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;\n  &lt;mrow&gt;\n    &lt;mfrac&gt;\n      &lt;mrow&gt;\n        &lt;mo&gt;‚àí&lt;/mo&gt;\n        &lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;\n        &lt;mo&gt;¬±&lt;/mo&gt;\n        &lt;msqrt&gt;\n          &lt;msup&gt;&lt;mi&gt;b&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;/msup&gt;\n          &lt;mo&gt;‚àí&lt;/mo&gt;\n          &lt;mn&gt;4&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi&gt;c&lt;/mi&gt;\n        &lt;/msqrt&gt;\n      &lt;/mrow&gt;\n      &lt;mrow&gt; &lt;mn&gt;2&lt;/mn&gt;&lt;mi&gt;a&lt;/mi&gt; &lt;/mrow&gt;\n    &lt;/mfrac&gt;\n  &lt;/mrow&gt;\n&lt;/math&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\t\t<p>Like HTML itself, its semantics are fairly weak - but also like HTML itself, it turns out that you can do quite a lot with that.  Given the markup above, your browser would render something like this:</p> \n\n\t\t<figure class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/math-out.png\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Screenshot showing MathML visual rendering output</figcaption>\n\t\t</figure>\n\n\t\t<p>And so, it looked like we had an answer for this, at last.</p> \n\n\t\t<blockquote>Narrator: That was, of course, before Wednesday.<br>\n\t\t(pause.)<br>\n\t\tOn Wednesday, <strike>Harold's wristwatch</strike> Chrome changed everything.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWork continued and Firefox shipped some kind of MathML support as early as 2006 and, for a time just about every browser had <em>someone</em> either working on implmentations or already shipped.  IE was sort of the last major holdout.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Narrator: If one had asked Harold, he would have said that this Wednesday was exactly like all the Wednesdays prior.  And he began it the same way he--</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBy 2013, all in all, things were looking pretty good for the MathML community.  \n\t\t</p>\n\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Harold: Hello?... Hello? Is someone there?</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThen, there was something of a shakeup in terms of browser engines: That February, Opera retired Presto and joined Google and Safari as \"WebKit\" browsers. Some worried about the loss of diversity in browser enginers.  Then, a few months later, Google announced that it would fork WebKit and create \"Blink\" and, very quickly, Opera announced it would use Blink too.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Narrator: Little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death.<br>\n \n\t\tHarold Crick: What? What? Hey! HELLOOO! What? Why? Why MY death? HELLO? Excuse me? WHEN?</blockquote>\n\t\t\n\n\t</section>\n\n\t\t\t\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Little did he know</contextual-heading>\t\t\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIn the process of forking, the Blink teams intent was to do a lot of refactoring and really focus on performance.  Along the way, they reviewed code and found that the newly landed contribution of MathML had a lot of complexity.  They found that it had several issues, including a security flaw.  It had no long-term owner on the team and would make refactoring a lot harder, so, they debated what to do with it.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Professor Hilbert: I've written papers on \"Little did he know.\" I've taught classes on \"Little did he know.\" I once gave an entire seminar based upon \"Little did he know.\" Sonofabitch, Harold... \"Little did he know.\" That means there's something he doesn't know, which means there's something you don't know... Did you know that?</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t On Wednesday, October 30, 2013, Google announced their decision: They would remove support for it in Blink, for now at least, and instead recommend use of a polyfill of sorts called MathJax.  \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tI think that it would be a mistake to read too much into this.  I don't think that Google was as much unified in a desire to kill <strike>Harold Crick</strike> MathML as they were in having to make a move and thinking that perhaps that was a reasonable choice at the time.   \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t Judgements about the quality of that choice aside,this meant that by 2013 estimates, the  projected native support of MathML was suddenly around <em>a billion users less than it had been just a day before.</em> \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tKaren Eiffel: I went out... to buy cigarettes and I figured out how to kill Harold Crick.\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\n<!--\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/fixed-it.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t</div>\n-->\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tThis has had some pretty complex effects on the status of MathML: It is left as one of a very small group of things in the platform which are in a very strange place in history. This situation has even been the <a href=\"https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/313\">topic of some discussion in the W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) recently</a> (and elsewhere).  Like Harold Crick, we're unsure quite which kind of story they are in.\n\t\t</p>  \n\n\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\tProfessor Hilbert: ..The only way to find out what story you're in is to determine what stories you're not in. Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out half of Greek literature, seven fairy tales, ten Chinese fables, and determined conclusively that you are not King Hamlet, Scout Finch, Miss Marple, Frankenstein's monster, or a golem. Hmm? Aren't you relieved to know you're not a golem?\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\n\t</section>\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Aren't you relieved to know you're not a golem?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAlong the way we began trying to collectively find new ways to think about how we go about evolving the whole <em>platform</em> in healtier ways than the past and explaining how we deal with where we are, and how we move forward - but this has actually not been great for MathML.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhile we generally accept the starting point of existing standards, because of the above, MathML doesn't fit neatly into this camp in the minds of some. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhile we say that the potential path to standardization of <em>new</em> elements lies in experimentation and proving need and use via Custom Elements, MathML predates custom elements by a long time.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhere does this leave MathML?  Asking that  community to be relieved that we now have custom elements seems a bit like asking them to be relieved that they aren't a golem.  \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Harold: You have to understand that this isn't a philosophy or a literary theory or a story to me. It's my life.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, now what?\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Earned Credits</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tAs I explained earlier, because of where it fit in history, I think MathML is an exceptional case.  I would argue that we should 'credit' MathML as if they'd used Custom Elements all along and just shortcut that whole aspect of the conversation.  But, then what?\n\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThinking through this is part of what led me to write <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Crisis.html\">Standards Crisis on Earth-1</a> and propose a thought excersize about experimentation and data and ask \"then what\"?  Because, in this light, I have to wonder what kind of message we are sending with how we choose to deal with it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\n\t\t<p>Imagine another universe in which a community works for 30 years.  They experiment.  After a while, they come up with a solution.  It's imperfect, like all solutions, but they manage to build a base.  It is included in <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/58439.html\">ISO/IEC</a>, HTML, <a href=\"http://idpf.org/epub/30\">ebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12572/OpenDocument-v1.0-os.pdf\">office</a> formats. They build an ecosystem around it.  They even manage to get major native implementations.  Despite lack of native support from two major vendors, or even a super clear way to go from 'here' to 'there', their base manages to expand to millions of documents.  \n\t\t</p>  \n\t\t\n\t\t<p>That is an <em>exceptionally</em> high bar, which I think we cannot expect of another community again, probably ever.  But imagine it did, because it's pretty close to reality here... Then what?  How do we standardize it, or why don't we?  Why?\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\tProfessor Hilbert: Harold, if you want to stay alive, you have to try something else.\n\t\tHarold: What?\n\t\tProfessor Hilbert: Nothing.\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\n\t</section>\n\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">I Can't Kill Harold Crick</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tBut, it's not just a general feeling of \"we have a duty to any community who did that much to give them some answers\" that is bothering me. It's  pressed further by who these groups are.  The groups who have invested in and continue to need MathML have names like the \"<em>National Science Foundation</em>\".  They serve altruitistic purposes like Higher Education and cancer research.  They aren't just important - they are literally among the very group of folks that the Web proposed to help from the very beginning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tGiven this, it feels almost fundamental to the spirit of the Web ‚Äî and good for us all ‚Äî that we make some extra effort to help close an important gap after nearly three decades.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Solutions</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tAs for myself, I believe that any suggestion of 'starting over' here is problematic.  It's not that there might not be 'better', but we need a starting point and to not largely accept the one that has this much success and investment already seems really bad.  I believe we have to find a \"standard way\" to ship MathML in some way that is better than the situation today. The polyfills are better than nothing, but they introduce many new challenges from performance to accessibility which are unfortunate and non-trivial.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p><em>Enter Igalia</em></p>\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tI believe that the best hope is through current work being done by Igalia.\n\t\t\tIf you aren't familliar with them, <a href=\"https://www.igalia.com/\">Igalia</a> is  very interesting and unique.  Most organizations involved in standards fit neatly into are either \"are a browser vendor\", or \"doesn't write browser implementations\".  The latter are sometimes at something of a disadvantage for reasons more practical, and less political, than we often imagine them to be.  Each vendor already has their own priorities, budgets, challenges and so on.  But Igalia provides a bridge between these two worlds.  They don't make a browser themselves, but they do contribute code and work to browser codebases, and have developed and maintain good relationships and trust at both ends.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWhen blink identified concerns with the implementation at the time of forking from webkit, Igalia worked with Apple to help right the situation and MathML continues to ship in Safari to this day.   \n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tCurrent efforts to find a path in blink are being funded by communities who really need MathML and current proposals involve using some new underlying primitives (some through Houdini) to help not only get MathML implmented in blink, but also to do so in a way that introduces no or minimal \"new magic\", but rather is well explained by common foundations. This seems as good an outcome as I can imagine and I really hope that it succeeds.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIf you think think this is a valuable and worthwhile effort, be sure to speak up.  If you work for someone who might think that this is important, tell them about it.  <a href=\"https://mathml.igalia.com/\">We can help fund these efforts too</a>. \n\t\t</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<p class=\"thanksTo\">Special thanks to many friends, Bruce Lawson, Michiel Bijil, Alice Boxhall, Daniel Ehrenberg and Lajja Shah for thoughtful discussions and insight on the topic along the way, or proofreading one of many developing evolutions of drafts of this piece.

If that was all you needed then, it's all you need now too.  The truth though is that even in the early days of the Web, it often wasn't: We wanted to do things  with the Web that would have made hand-authoring pages an untenable solution.  In fact, the first real, practical use of HTML at CERN by Sir Tim-Berners Lee and team generated that HTML by way of C and database services.  Perhaps there has been a decrease in the number of sites that could even be realistically hand authored without more than that because of increased expectations or something, but by and large, it seems to me that complexity in delievering a website isn't so much \"new\" as it is \"shifted\".</p>\n\n\t<p>Along the way there were a ton of complex things, and each was rooted in whole different languages:  Java frameworks and .NET frameworks and PHP and so on.  Because of that, each of those had their own build systems (sometimes a few), application servers, package managers and so on.  So, the idea that we could do these things in the same language (JavaScript) and protocols seems like actually a really good thing to me.</p>\n\n\t<p>So... This isn't just \"Things sure have gotten complicated.  Remember when they were simpler?  Pepperidge Farm Remembers.\"  What it is about may, at times, read a little like that, but the point I am trying to make is subtler - it is about how we <em>manage</em> that, and how it makes us feel.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Time for play</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>I don't really know how to describe the period from about 1994-1998 other than to say that it kind of felt like play.  Occasionally frustrating and confusing play to be sure, but each challenge was semi-contained and full of exicting little rewards that drove you on.  It was like climbing a series of hills to find inceasingly beautiful views from the top of each one, pressing you on to tackle the next.  There was something so engaging about it that I, and many others, spent <em>way</em> too much time just playing with it.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If there is a thing that I feel a loss of, it's kind of that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>A lot of information flows past our eyeballs - far faster than we have time to actually learn about.  That's ok.  It's natural to have a spectrum of knowledge about things that can range from \"I've kind of heard about it and sort of vaguely understand the concept\", all the way to \"I really understand this thing, very well, and can really use it\".  The further you want to move something along that spectrum, the more time investment it takes.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>For me, often this means that allocating time to sit down and actually try to get to know something remotely significant in practice, needs to align with some a real-life need, at least vaguely.  However, sometimes, by the time you get there, you can find that there are a whole bunch of <em>dependent</em> things that you also haven't learned yet, in the way obscuring your ability to actually do so.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I have occasionally spent hours shaving not one, but several yacks... with a spoon... only to eventually not get to spend much time with the thing I sat down to try in the first place. That can feel really bad and kind of overwhelming, and it really can kind of pile up on you.</p>\n\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Tools</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Perhaps because of this, I love tools like CodePen for their simple ability to get out of my way and let me focus on something.  They are where I have 'played' the most for the last couple of years.  I don't generally make things there to show off, rather, they're where I think and explore. There, I can very easily use the most basic/common sorts of tools to focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript - including preprocessors without worrying about all the rest of it.  You don't need to know how to setup Webpack or Babel, or organize your project, or setup a server or a bunch of other things to use tools like those, and that's all  great.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>On the other hand, looking back, I've probably occasionally used these great tools poorly, making <em>that</em> particular problem a little worse.  My 'playground' was pretty far removed from my 'real' space and managing both ends of that requires some careful planning and extra hoop jumping.  Eventually the time always comes when I need something those tools don't have, or have to take those nice little experiments from their playground and send them into the real world and figure all of that stuff out - and then, sometimes, the things I haven't learned are all piled up.  Again, that's not on the tools, that's on me.</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Then, Glitch</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>When I first heard about Glitch, I kind of thought it was a REPL kind of tool, or something along the lines of a CodePen or many other things \"in that vein\".  I sort of chalked it up as \"like other stuff I already am familliar with and probably not that exciting\".  I poked the site briefly and, I'm sad to say, didn't \"get it\".  It didn't look as slick as some of the things I was already familliar with and, after just a few minutes, I just made a mental note to \"maybe look at it again someday\" and moved on to invest my time elsewhere.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But then, suddenly, I expectedly had some free time to catch up and decided to go back and look again. One month later I can honestly say:</p>\n\n\t\t<p><em>I don't think that I have ever loved a bit of tech as much as this.</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>For the first time in a long time, I feel like this is something really different and exciting.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">So many things I love</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I guess I can see how it is potentially easy to miss just how great it is the first time around.  Click the 'remix' button and think \"well... I guess that's cool?\" The editor doesn't look like much at first.  Is it kind of like CodePen, I guess?  But social somehow? Don't we already have tools and archetypes and templates and things that help you get started? </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>If this is your initial take -- give it a minute:  It is full of so many nice surprises.  With Glitch, the more I use it, the more I dicover, and the more I discover, the more I love it.   Some of them are small and just 'pleasant' and others are shockingly great.  I'll start with the former...</p>\n\n\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">Small, but enjoyable surprises</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p>First, the editor has more than you think at first glance. It's actually pretty nice.  You can move, copy and rename files pretty easily.  It has code collapsing and 'as you type' linting and inline error reporting, and it has a dark mode that is actually pretty easy on the eyes.  It's also 'type aware' and has diffrent integrations.  Images and media, for example have a little asset management thing and get hosted on a CDN without you having to deal with that - and your package.json, if that's your thing, has an NPM integration that let's you just search for packages and click 'add'.  So nice.</p>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">More importantly: It's all real.</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Remixing is fun, and actualy surpsingly helpful as a way to learn and get started and begin to explore.  That is considerably more valuable than I realied and helps a ton with the problem I described above about there being so many things.  But it's also only part of the allure for me.  Another part is that it isn't <em>separate</em>, it's <em>real</em>, and there is so much <em>there</em>. Together, these feel like a powerful combination that re-ignites a spark for me.  It's been so delightful to increasingly realize.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p> \n\t\t\t\t\tEvery time I think that's as far as this is going to go and I'm going to have to get into 'the real thing', it just keeps giving because it <em>is all real</em>.  It's not just 'here is a local server and project layout that you can start with in a semi-fake way', it's <em>real stuff</em>.  You can tackle real things, and just keep growing it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>For example, that's not just some things that kind of look like files on the left - those are <em>actual files</em> that exist on an <em>actual</em> container - and you didn't have to learn how to use docker or something, it just is.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>You can access a terminal window by simply clicking a button.  You don't have to ssh into it or something, you just click.  It's almost just like it exists right there on your computer -- but it is real.  You can click the 'log' button and see the server logs.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Your server will have HTTPS and be in a legit subdomain, right away, where you can get started with lots of powerful features.  Service Workers work here, right away, in exactly the way they will in real life.  Your site's local storage is your local storage, not everyone elses.  Your site's permissions are your permissions, not someone else's.  It's all 'real'.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Further, it's yours - you can just say \"give me the git\" and you've got it. But you don't even have to in order to use some of the features you'd love.  There is a <em>rewind</em> button that you can use to undo time.  Wow.  So great!  You can also use a .gitignore to hide files from the editor, and store secrets with things like service account information in a place that only you can see.</p> \n\n\t\t\t\t<p>You can <em>lock</em> your project and then it's kind of private, people won't stumble across it and be able to remix it....You can feel safe exploring all over the place - this is where I've spent most of my time - just having fun and growing ideas that I'm not sure I want to share yet...</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tBut you can also <em>invite</em> people, even to the locked projects.  You can create <em>teams</em> and even collaboratively edit as if it were Google docs or a shared etherpad or something.  So. Great.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Oh hey, are you having a problem with your server - click 'debug' and you can connect a debugger right to it... Waaat?</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Need more help?  There is community support where people can help you get unstuck.</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Really, I started playing with some personal projects.mostly not public yet a month ago and just exploring.  I haven't been able to put it down since.  I just want to keep playing.  Really, it's the most fun I have had in so long, and because of that I have probably learned and accomplished more in that time than any time in recent memory.  Give it a try.  It's <em>so great.</em></p>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</section>\n",

If you've read my pieces before or are otherwise already familliar with the W3C Technical Architecture Group, you can skip ahead to \"<a href=\"#alright-tell-me-about-this-election\">Alright, tell me about this election</a>\".  If, however, you find youself thinking \"Elections in W3C? Politics?\" then let me fill you in.</p> \n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\"><span id=\"user-content-elections-w3c-politics\">Elections? W3C Politics?</span></contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Yes.   I wrote a brief (~400 word) \"<a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/W3CPrimer.html\">Primer for Busy People</a>\" on the general \"parts\" of the W3C and introducing the two elected bodies, and if you find any of these terms confusing, pop over and give that a read.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>While working groups (like the CSS Working Group, for example) are unbounded in size and composed through 'appointment', the Technical Architecture Group (TAG) is kind of different.  It is chaired by \"The Director\" (still currently Sir Tim Berners-Lee) and composed of a very small number of \"seats\", a little over half of those are filled through an election process.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\"><span id=\"user-content-ok-but-what-does-the-tag-do\">Ok, but what does the TAG <em>do</em>?</span>\n\t\t\t</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>While working groups are focused on solving particular problems, the TAG's job is to make sure it all makes sense together - to  be a kind of steering committee for the W3C/Web at large.  They are charged with the broad view and direction - asking questions about things that seem problematic or inconsistent and giving helpful feedback and advice to help pull it all together and guide everyone along.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>So, basically, if you have 'broader' concerns within the W3C, the TAG can help guide things along and maybe help give them a nudge.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Houdini</a>, for example, was a discussion that began in the W3C TAG and became a Task Force with members from all of the major browser vendors on it.   In merely a couple of years (that is light speed in Web standards), things that seemed highly implausible and maybe not worth the time now seem both reasonable and exciting to all the members I've talked to, not just those currently implementing.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>Even simple things like making sure in reviews that API signatures were similar and consistent across the platform are a huge win.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\"><span id=\"user-content-alright-tell-me-about-this-election\">Alright, tell me about this election!</span></contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I think it's fairly important that we keep The W3C TAG staffed with the right mix of people for the right times and continue to improve how the W3C and standards work.  I think it is important that Web developers are kept in mind and have a voice, and so for the last few years I have blogged about who I thought should be elected, and why - and asked developers to lend their support asking W3C member companies to support this choice (or make their own).  This worked.  Candidates that we publicly supported were overwelmingly elected.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\"><span id=\"user-content-and-then\">And then...</span>\n\t\t\t</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p>A little over a year ago, the W3C changed the way that elections work.  Previously, people could cast 1 vote per open seat and the people with the most ballots filled the seats.  It was imperfect, but it was simple.  As a result of the change, however, <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/W3CTAGElectionChange.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">things got more complicated</a>.  Now, members cast, effectively, a single vote.  It has lots of preferences, but only one is actually counted.  Arguing for a slate of people has no positive effect in this system, it's specifically designed with this as a feature.  Further, I can imagine negative ones.  Some people will debate the latter, I'm sure, but the net result has been that it's kept me from making a case for who I think the W3C should elect since and instead focused entirely on helping make sure there are good options in the first place.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>So, there's an election and with luck, we have <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2018/12/03-tag-nominations\" rel=\"nofollow\">4 super great nominees</a>  for 3 open seats: Alice, Tess, Travis and Sangwhan (in alphabetical order).  Really, I love them all.  They are all super smart, I think they would all be great on TAG.  I wish we could just say \"yes please\" and seat them all.  Good luck to all of you friends.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\"><span id=\"user-content-excitement\">Excitement</span>\n\t\t\t</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Since I've already explained that I worry about making a case for a particular slate of people with these changes, and that I'll be satisfied with any outcome in this election, you might wonder why I am writing at all.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The answer is pretty simple: <em>Because Alice Boxhall is running, and I'm pretty excited about it.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I've hoped Alice would run for TAG for a while now, and now that she is I just want to say that I wholeheartedly support her.  If I had a ballot, I would enthusiastically place her name in my #1 spot because I think the TAG needs someone just like her.  As I say, <em>all of these candidates are great</em> and bring something positive - but Alice brings something that I don't think anyone else can.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>If you don't know Alice (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundress\" rel=\"nofollow\">@sundress</a> on Twitter), she is part of a (great) team whose wide ranging-responsibilities include just about everything you can imagine surrounding accessibility on nearly everything involving the words \"Web\" or \"Chrome\" in any way.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Usually, when we're talking about people who work 'at browser vendor', it's normally not a person with accessibility attached to their name as a primary goal. And conversely, we have a lot of really great accessibility experts who just don't have the technical experience of actually working on a browser engine. But Alice combines the perspectives of implementer, developer advocate, and ally for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>She's worked on excellent (and free) education about accessibility which is really understandable for developers. At the same time, she doesn't assume the problem is just that we're simply all too lazy to learn something - she empathizes with how overwhelming, or sometimes even convoluted things can feel and how hard it can be to get even simple things right and that this won't yield good results. So she also works on tools to make it easier. Have you ever used the little color contrast thing right in the Chrome DevTools style tab? That's Alice, for example.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That's a lot, and already I think, more than enough reason to vote for her - but there's more: She doesn't just care about educating developers and making it easier for them to get right - she's also interested in improving the platform itself and including developers in that process. That's how I came to know her, in fact. She has written articles, helped incubate proposals, created polyfills, popularized them enough to let developers help iterate, test and prove we have a good answer that helps make it easier and more plausible to 'get it right'.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I feel like <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2018/12/03-tag-nominations#ab\" rel=\"nofollow\">she explains all of this better herself</a> in her statement, but, essentially:  It seems to me that Alice brings a rare and broad blend of skills, perspective and knowledge that I think would really benefit us all to have at to the TAG table, and that she is uniquely qualified to do so.  She's not just one thing - she's an 'all of the above' that is rare.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>So... I'm happy that Alice is runnning.  I'm excited.  I support her.  If what she writes resonates with you too, and you agree that she would be an important addition to TAG, let someone know.  If you know a W3C member, tell them.  If not, just share your support.  History seems to show that if enough people share it, it gets seen.  I hope lots of people place her in their #1 spot on the ballot before the polls close at 11:59pm on January 4th.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<figure class=\"captioned-image\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://bkardell.com/media/Vote_Alice.png\">\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption>Vote for Alice</figcaption>\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</section>\n",

We widely agree on a lot of foundational \"bits\" even across numerous standards bodies.  But, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about how to make this really \"click\". While the basic challenges are largely similar across standards bodies, HTML is especially interesting because it adds additional complexities...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>We all agree that standardization should be based on \"science\" and that it should involve developers and experimentation \"in the wild\". \"The path to standardization leads through custom elements\" is the refrain in both universes.  The idea that <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Dropping-The-F-Bomb-On-Standards.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">standards bodies should work more like dictionary editors</a> is a pretty well accepted \"concept\" all around.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But, \"<em>how</em>, specifically, do we do those things?\" is as yet unanswered and, it seems quite difficult to get people to discuss details in our own universe.  Why?  Because custom elements are young and it's very hard to speculate about hyptothetical elements and futures.  It very quickly gets into all kinds of weeds and sputters out.</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/batman-robin-science.jpeg\" alt=\"Batman and Robin doing science\">\n\t\t</aside>\n \n\t\t<p>So, that's the idea with the multiverse: Perhaps by imagining a universe in which all of the HTML-5 elements arose in this fashion is, in a way, easier.  We don't have to get people to accept that some kind of \"section\" element \"might be useful\" or \"might get popular\".  We can simply say \"it did\" in precise parallel with our universe.  It's easier to imagine.  It allows us to get to the \"... then what?\" and focus on the actual questions.</p>\n\t\t<p>Also, I think it is more fun.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">\"Data\" initial handwaving</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>So, we've said that data <em>exists</em> on Earth-2, but that doesn't mean we have it.  In fact, that's job #1:  Any kind of \"science\" is going to inevitably involve measuring.  But who measures? How? And what do we accept that those measurements actually mean? What do we do with that information?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Who measures and how is a potentially more complex topic than it seems on its face, so I'd like to just handwave over for a moment and come back to it later. For now, let's imagine that that \"something like\" The HTTP Archive report on element use, will do for initial discussion.</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/felicity-headsup.jpeg\" alt=\"Comic image of Arrow's Felicity Smoake hacking some data\">\n\t\t\t<p>Let's just imagine, \"I'm in\".</p>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t<p>Ah ha... This is probably the first thing we can learn: That report is not currently capturing custom elements at all. In theory though, I think that is pretty easy to remedy, so let's just pretend that we can actuallly get an Earth-2 report identical to the one linked, except that all of the \"HTML5 elements\" in that table are custom element dopplegangers like x-section, x-aside or x-progress instead.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Usage and Languages</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>If we look at that information (measuring use on unique URLs to feather out some local biases in which a few authors use it really a lot) as a chart, it would look like this.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6d67a581785415fec403ca0b58f80533849a82b8/68747470733a2f2f626b617264656c6c2e636f6d2f6d656469612f7468656f7265746963616c2d656c656d656e742d7573652e706e673f617364\" alt=\"simply visualization of data from the linked HTTP Archive report illustrating a curve with a dramatically increasing drop off\">\n\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t<p>One thing that you'll notice is just how quickly usage \"falls off\".

Fascinatingly, it seems that no matter what dataset you look at, about 20% of words account for 80% of word occurances and you wind up with a similar kind of drop off and curve.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>80% of pages counted here contain the elements <code tag-esc=\"\">html</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">head</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">body</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">meta</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">title</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">script</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">div</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">link</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">a</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">img</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">span</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">li</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">ul</code> and <code tag-esc=\"\">p</code>, but then things begin to drop off and they seem to do so kind of precipitously. \n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But even simple, mature and common tags like <code tag-esc=\"\">em</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">strong</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">u</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">b</code> and <code tag-esc=\"\">i</code> which are easy to use regardless of how you even create your content are used far less. <code tag-esc=\"\">i</code> has even been popularly overloaded for use as an icon (no comment), increasing its chances of use. But none of these, not a single one, is in the \"Top 20\". Even with all of those advantages, <code tag-esc=\"\">i</code> appears on less than 40% of URLs and <code tag-esc=\"\">em</code> on less than 14%.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In fact, of this list of 135 elements that are actually part of some Earth-1 standard, almost 40% of them have less than 1% use. This is again, interesting as nearly half of all word use across any corpus is the same core 50-100 words, and nearly the other half will be words that appear in that same corpus only once. What's more, it's kind of hard to communicate using only those core words.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So what's the point? Well, simply that we should probably expect elements to follow \"similar rules\" of distribution and occurence, and that this should probably inform what we accept these measures to mean. It might seem at first like 1% (or even 5%) is \"basically useless compared to this other thing\" but that's not actually at all the case.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">\"Dictionary Research\"</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Ideally, someone (or something) would be \"watching\" data that probably looks a lot like the above and looking for slang that is getting popular enough to warrant further review. Ideally they would have some kind of rule.</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/Batcomputer_001.jpg\">\n\t\t\t<em>In the Batcave Detective Comics #607 (Nov. 1989) By Norm Breyfogle</em>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t<p>Then, in terms of a language, like English, once some slang triggers the metaphorical batcomputer and \"has their attention\" research have to review really a lot of actual uses to see if there is an accepted definition of this word. It seems we would need that too. We need to know not just that those tags appear, but whether they mean the same thing, and are used consistently enough to draw a definition from. It may well be the case that a lot of people are simply using a common word for very different and totally incompatible purposes.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What specific rule(s) would work to trigger such review is certainly debatable, but I think we can probably come up with at least initial ideas and even elimiate some as \"probably unreasonable\" by thinking through this exersize a little more.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>For example, practically speaking the more use it has, the harder this would be. I think that we can probably agree that reviewing uses of Earth-2's <code tag-esc=\"\">x-section</code> would be pretty hard, because it's used on nearly 1/3 of all URLs in that report. Worse, as I will argue later, it's probably much worse than that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So, combined with what we know about languages and word occurence, this seems to argue that we need to a rule that catch more, earlier. Even a rule like \"any element that appears in the Top 100 occurences of a report like that\" will miss important things, and maybe be too late. Anything considerably more stringent than that seems (like, Top 40 or Top 50) is almost certainly not going to work. Or, perhaps it is a report that only shows the top N custom elements by occurence.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But, I think that it's more than just 'when do we review' - I think in many cases we want to proactively work more closely with at least some developers, very early on. There are several attempts at this sort of thing, but currently at least, we've not figured our exactly how to do this or how it fits into standarization.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In any case, we can safely imagine that <code tag-esc=\"\">x-section</code> use grabs attention, and that after some herculean review we agree that there is a common use/definition... Now what?</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Dictionary, or Dictionaries?</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Well, now it gets even a little fuzzier. The most straightforward way of understanding \"standardization\" here is that elements become part of HTML. I think that at a minimum, everyone in all universes would agree that HTML should contain the \"core words\", but what are those? \"section\" is almost certainly one, but it's unclear what the \"core words\" really should be. Further, even in spoken languages real communication usualy requires more than core words. It seems very likely to me that HTML should have (and arguably does on Earth-1 already) at least some \"more specific\" words too. But, I'm not sure where we draw the line, or that we're discussing what that even means.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>On Earth-1, for example, before \"HTML5\" one could definitely argue that HTML itself was about really general things whose semantics were about basic text. Earth-2's version of 'core words' still has that characteristic. But our HTML now includes elements like progress, which, in practice, does not really seem like that. Unless you really, really squint at it and imagine use cases that don't actually exist, progress really only has meaning with dynamic state - for something more \"applicationy\". It is undeniable that people build applications with the Web - but, the question of whether HTML itself should include tags about \"application stuff\" was very real: Many converations took place in the early-mid 2000s. We decided \"yes\" and put them into HTML5 - but if things developed the way described on Earth-2 where HTML didn't include that sort of thing natively... Would we, add it to HTML itself? I'm honestly not sure.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What I do know is that we will have to draw lines: Not everything useful, even useful to significant numbers of people, can probably 'fit' in HTML. What do we do with those? Do we just pretend they don't exist? Are they simply relegated to life as custom elements and everything that currently entails?</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/dc-kids-dictionary.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3808531-the-super-dictionary\">A DC dictionary for kids</a>.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t<p>If so, this seems like kind of a pity for a lot of reasons. First, the \"price\" of doing otherwise expands as very popular ideas build on one another. Second, some kind of standardization is still probably helpful, even if that is outside of HTML itself, and it seems that encouraging and incentivizing that for things that can find an audience would be helpful. Is it possible that there is some kind of thing inbetween \"It's part of HTML\" and \"It's just a custom element like any other\" which has some advatages and incentives that help encourage good things to happen?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Some idea around helping optimize or virtualy eliminate loading times, for example, would be a big deal. Perhaps if dictionary researchers idenitifed something like this we could provide a way to expose a 'universal cache' registry or something that effectively registered a hash with the browser itself that developers could lean on to avoid 99% of loading for that definition... or something? Perhaps those could also use WebAssembly to further reduce parse? I don't know, honestly, I'm just describing vague ideas about what be possible 'advantage' characterstics of an 'inbetween' soution.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The closest thing I have seen to discussions like this are <a href=\"https://github.com/drufball/layered-apis\">layered APIs</a> but I'm not quite sure that that's really the same thing, or is \"it.\" I'd like us to think this through a lot more.</p> \n\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Codifying vs Similar Solutioning</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Another thing that I think plays into this thinking about the story of how we go from custom element to native HTML.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Again, considering that Earth-2's data suggests unequivocably that there should be a standard \"section\"... What does that actually mean in it's final state, and, probably as importantly - how do we arrive there along the way?\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>Let's imagine that, they decide to just make a native section tag now. As always happens, a browser or two actually does the work and starts shipping that. An Earth-2 developer starting a new a new project is faced with a 'new' kind of problem that I think we'e never faced before: They can choose between a popular custom element or it's native doppleganger, but they are written differently. Ideally, they would start using the \"native\" one and optionally load the custom element definition as a polyfill -- but how? As far as I have seen there is no staightforward path, advice or pattern here about how to span this gap.</p>\n\t\t<p>A developer could, perhaps skip loading the actual definition, but they have to keep using the custom element markup and registry... For example, perhaps they could write something like:</p>\n\n\t\t<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">if (customElements.get('x-section')) {\n    customElements.define('x-section', HTMLSectionElement)\n} else {\n    // load polyfill\n}</code></pre> \n\t\t<p>But... If I think about it - that's kind of screwed up and makes it seem harder to \"dig out of\" that situation. Until all browsers ship it, people are extremely unlikely to use it because so many already have a custom element solution that works everywhere. Until people use it, browsers are unlikely to priotitize its shipping, even if we can agree it is good. Even once everyone has shipped, there is legacy - and the bigger that legacy gets, the harder this problem is. This approach seems like it would cause the 'legacy' to considerably expand rather than contract.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That's kind of interesting because it's both a new problem for us (again, as far as I can see) and a problem that language dictionary editors don't have. They don't mint a similar solution and attempt to coin a new word that means the same thing as something in popular parlance.  They just say \"yeah, that's officially a word\".</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/similar-flashes.jpeg\" alt=\"depiction of many 'similar' but not 'same' earth flashes in TV and comics. Only the concept of 'speedster flash' is standard.\">\n\t\t</aside>\n\n\t\t<p>Perhaps instead an 'inbetween' solution could be helpful in many of these cases too. Allowing that x-foo could actually be a standard and making it easy to opt-into a more official and 'advantaged one' would actually be a lot closer to what language dictionary editor's do, and maybe that is important in maybe useful ways?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Again, I don't know. These are things I would like to see more discussion on.</p>\n\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\"><em>Actually</em> Measuring and Researching</contextual-heading>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Thusfar we have simply imagined that the data from the HTTP Archive is our data set. But, as I said, I think that getting the \"real\" data that we actually need is probably going to be trickier than that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>To illustrate, let's turn back the <code tag-esc=\"\">progress</code> (or <code tag-esc=\"\">x-progress</code>) example. Is that really an accurate read on it's use? I would wager, very probably not. Why? Well, I think that it's because of what we're measing there, and how.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>While the HTTP Archive has a really a lot of data, it's actually not even the tip of the iceberg that is the real \"Web\" (ie, all the things you view in a Web browser). As great as it is, it is neither unbiased (not in an intentional or negative sense) nor complete.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><code tag-esc=\"\">x-progress</code> is an example of something that I would fully expect to under-report on the HTTP Archive report. It is freqently only inserted into a document termporarily, and based upon some significant user interaction. It's considerably more likely to be used in things that are more \"appy\". These are kind of problems for the HTTP Archive to get it even if they are \"public\" but those sorts of things also are frequently \"behind\" something that makes it even harder -- requiring a login, or a coprporate intranet, for example. So, that really skews what is going to show up here and, if we are looking at occurences and ranks as our 'trigger' or how we go back and do the research - that's going to make whole classes of very useful elements substantially disavantaged and others subtantially overly advantaged in ways that might be worth considering.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What's more, as I said, it includes a lot of sites, but it's still limited not only by the above, but also based on some measure of 'popularity'. Depending on what you are talking about this can have a really big impact and, I think, lead us astray. Eating food, for example, is critical - but I spend far more time doing all sorts of other innane things. It's less popular by that measure than, say, playing Playstation. But... idk... it feels important.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Another, probably better, way to measure might be browser telemetry. But, afaik, browser telemetry doesn't give us back URLs or a good way to reach and research those things either.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Further, we'd have to be careful to somehow collect and coalese this data seamlessly too to avoid other kinds of hiccups though. For example, there are sites/apps which are keenly important and widely used for specific purposes who, for various reasons, people avoid certain browsers. This is bad for the Web, but it isn't always for equally bad reasons: Telemetry data for Firefox, for example, would have for a long time seriously under-reported how important video was for me, saying it was near 0. That would have been entirely untrue though, I almost always have videos playing. Rather, most of us quickly learned that Firefox wouldn't play a lot of videos and consciously would view sites with videos in Chrome.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Similarly, I have seen other very particular but not rare use cases in which specific browsers are recommended not to use for something kind of specific because of issues with thirdparty software. Businesses and developers frequently have to play a very delicate balancing act and, it would be terrible if, for example a browser were to claim that their own low use didn't need to be specially reconicled somehow with another browser's much higher numbers because that may well indicate such a gap.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So....?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, it seems like, somehow, we're going to start figuring out how we really science the shit out of this. How do we do it? How do we answer all of these questions and setup processes (and maybe new roles?) to make this really hum?\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<aside class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/science-the-shit.jpeg\">\n\t\t</aside>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tWe want developers to play a big role here, but without answers, developers speculate about the future.  I've seen this already and I worry that this could be disillusioning if that speculation winds up being far from reality.  I don't want people to feel misled or disullusioned.  If this goes badly, our hypothetical visitor from another earth might be right: Our standards might be in trouble.  In fact, I think that this might even already more relevant and pressing than we realize... but I'll save that argument for another post.\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tIt's entirely possible that there are some fairly complete and mature thought around some of these issues that I've just not yet heard articulated.   I'm fairly certain though that even if there are, there are still many additional discussions to be had, changes to try and so on before we've really figured it out - so I would love to have (or hear) more of those conversations.  It definitely seems to me like there is a lot of value in having some open conversations on these topics. \n\t\t</p>\n\t</section>\n",

I was interviewed by 5 people at the same time and... it was a surpisingly tough interview.  At the same time, I had no real pressure on me because I had another offer on the table already.  I wound up doing pretty well and, more importantly, actually asking a lot of questions myself.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tI'll never forget that interview, not because of how challenging it was but because I was able to just talk to them, and I immediately <em>liked</em> this team.  We had a connection.  They were smart, friendly, articulate and excited.  The work they were doing was interesting.  Further, the basic idea of expanding available higher ed and lifelong learning was a thing that I could feel good about in ways that I couldn't about a lot of other jobs I had interviewed for.  And so, when they made me an offer, despite the fact that it paid less than the one I already had in hand, I happily went off to work with them instead.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tOver the years, the precise aspects and focus of my job itself have evolved a number of times as things have shifted around but, it's almost always been around something \"core\" and generally closer to users than to say crunching numbers and processing data or machine learning.  Nearly all of my work has been in larger efforts, working on central projects.  Over the years, this has afforded me many unique challenges and the opportunity to work with a lot of teams and people on a lot of projects with very different needs, skills and legacy. As such, I feel like I was afforded the opportunity to see a lot that many never get to, and to try to help make things better.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t  This, in turn led me to actually get <em>involved</em> with Web standards instead of just following them and then to talk to even more people about the things that matter to us all and ultimately to try to improve how we approach standards themselves.  At this, I feel that I have been reasonably successful.  There are many and complex reasons why I stayed at the same place for so long, but no small part of that was I have always felt a real <em>connection</em> with a number of the people there.  The aims and visions expressed and established in that initial interview really stuck with me.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The End of an Era</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>\n\n\t\t\tBut all of this is prologue.  A week ago, my (former) company had a Reduction in Force, (aka layoffs) and I was affected.  It happens.  So, it's with somewhat mixed emotions that I move on.  On the one hand, it will be hard to say goodbye to a lot of friends and let go.  On the other hand, moving on and finding new opportunities can also be good.  When word came to me, I was with a number of friends in the industry.  Each of them were kind and sympathetic and I'm extremely glad to have been in their company at the time.  Many offered to connect me with someone, but all had the same question:  \n\t\t\t\"So, what are you looking for?  What do you <em>want</em> to do?\"\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>  \n\t\t\tThe funny thing is that it forced me to realize rather suddenly that it's been a minute since anyone has really <em>asked</em> me this question.  As I look around the industry I see that many of my friends careers have gone down slightly different and interesting paths that sound very intersing to me and that I think I might be interested in.  It's kind of exciting to be able to consider something slightly different.  Advocacy and relations, for example, are pretty different from what my day job has been, but they are a thing that I do outside of work and the idea of being able to give that my focus is super interesting!  Or, there are a ton of ways to skin accessibility challenges that could be really interesting too.  Working on an accessibility product could be interesting, for example.  Or working with a CMS vendor to embrace modern standards and find ways to improve things like offline, performance or accessibility - those could be fun too.  But those are just some examples - I kind of feel like there are many things that I could do and manage to bring something interesting to the table, and to be happy... So, I'm thinking about it.\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So... Now What?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p> \n\t\t\tWell, I've begun making a list of things that are kind of important to me...\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Remain remote.  I have been a fully remote employee since 2009.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Continue in standards work with some kind of support, even if very limited.  That is, at a minimum it can't be actively opposed to the idea and ideally would not require my only involvement to be through nights, weekends and vacations.</li> \n\t\t\t<li>Interact with other developers.  One of my favorite things to do is talk with other developers.  I like to share and to have people share with me - to find what pain they experience or thoughts they have about something people are talking about.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Do good.  This can take many forms, but ultimately it is what compells me to work on standards, it is what compells me to be interested in accessibility, and so on.  I'd like, at the end of the day, to feel like there is some value in what I do that goes beyond a simple bottom line.  I would love to be able to advocate.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Be intellectually stimulated and work on interesting but not entirely foreign problems.  That is, I'd like to keep it about the Web, but the Web is a big topic with lots of interesting areas.  I'm interested in the possibility of perhaps working from perspectives that I haven't before.  </li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\tSo, that's it... Luckily I have a little breathing room to take a beat and hopefully find something I love.  I'd love to hear your thoughts if you have them:  If you know of some place that has a need that you feel like I might be good at, let me know.

I thought they were good candidates when they ran the first time, neither of been there particularly long and the record shows that they're both doing good work.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Another candidate's (Reto) statement makes me actively worry that adding them to the TAG would potentially undo some of what I see as valuable progress.  I'm sure his work is excellent, but for this reason, if you asked how much I support him in this particular election, the answer is \"I think that would the <em>least desirable</em> outcome\" because actually, I think that the work we've seen TAG doing in the last few years is on a really <em>good</em> track.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The fourth candidate (Lukasz) is somewhere in between those two postions:  While I would be sad to see either David or Andrew not be reelected, nothing in his statement leads me to believe he wants to change what the TAG has been doing and his experience is broader.  In truth, I just don't know a lot about Lukasz compared to current, sitting members.  They are \"proven\" and \"known\".  But there are things I like about this candidate's statement.  So in this particular election, all I can say really is I support them \"considerably less than fully, but more than 0\".\n        </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The Old Ways</contextual-heading>\n        <p>\n            Until recently, the W3C used a simple plurality voting system to elect for TAG and AB.  In the old model, each member could cast <em>one vote per available open seat</em>: They'd simply, for example, vote for Andrew and David.  When voting closed, they'd simply count up the votes for each candidate and the ones with the highest totals win the seats.  Simple enough.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Plurality systems are not without well known flaws.  They aren't expressive.  Given an election with 3 candidates (A, B and C).  You might really, really like Candidate A, and might you really, really <em>dislike</em> the idea of Candidate C being elected, and your feelings about Candidate B could be anywhere in between the two extremes.  Plurality elections are, ultimately, won by the difference.  This means that in a 3 way race you have to guess whether your preferred candidate is actually \"electable\" becauseby not increasing the competitive count of Candidate B (as you would have if Candidate A weren't an option), Candidate C gains.  This is unfortunate.  It is, however, at least very easy to understand.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            One of the key problems with plurality voting is that it just isn't very expressive and also therefore encourages less than perfectly \"honest\" voting.  It doesn't capture the true intents of the voter.  Perhaps a lot of \"spoilers\" are actually far more widely acceptable than we think, for example, and if people could safely just express that then maybe we'd have outcomes that more people were more happy with.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            To this end, there are <em>lots</em> of other forms of voting that aim to do better and, recently, the W3C has switched the one they use.  <em>Who</em> to for vote for isn't the only question anymore - it's now also <em>how</em> to vote and <em>what does my vote mean?</em>  This is new and, I am worried likely to confuse.  In fact, I am not at all confident that W3C membership at large actually understood the implications when this was approved, so, let me explain the implications...\n        </p>\n    </section>\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Implications</contextual-heading>\n        <p>\n            I want to state very clearly that I am generally supportive of a more expressive voting system that allows true intents to be recorded and considered more accurately.  What's important to realize, however, is that given the same pool of voters, the same information, and the same candidates - different systems will have different outcomes.  There is no inherently \"right\" answer, there are simply outcomes and the ability for us to judge collectively whether those are good or bad.  So, let's do that...\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Let's imagine, hypothetically, that 65% of people felt approximately the way that I do: The <em>least desirable outcome</em> is to give Reto one of the available seats.  All of those people agree that both seats should go to either David, Andrew or Lukasz.  What we disagree on, to lesser degrees is how strongly we feel about each one.  But 35% of people feel precisely the opposite: Reto is their first choice.  They think that the TAG has taken a wrong turn in recent years.  Perhaps they read his statement and they think he'll bring more semantic web stuff and more 'conceptual innovation' back to TAG.  The least desirable outcome to <em>them</em> is that both incumbents get relected.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            So, given this information: What should happen?  Well, here are my own feelings:\n        </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Ideally the candidate who is least acceptable to 65% of people would not be elected, and it wouldn't require strategy to acheive that aim.</li>\n                <li>Ideally, the 2 candidates with the widest support should get the seats.</li>\n                <li>Ideally the system helps deal with the \"but they probably can't win\" bias by letting people accuratey express their honest preferences, thereby giving candidates with actual potential (instead of just perceived potential) a real shot.</li>\n            </ul>\n        <p></p>\n\n        <p>\n            However, given this hyptothetical scenario, this is not actually what happens with the system recently adopted.  What would happen in that system is that the candidate who is the least acceptable to 65% of people is interpreted as the best choice and is pretty much guaranteed a seat.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            To me, this feels like a bug - but it is actually a design <em>feature</em> of the system that's been chosen.  As I said, there isn't a right or wrong answer to \"how should it work\". There are only inputs and outputs that we can discuss and weigh.  There are reasons that it is designed this way and proponents view this as precisely what should happen.  But this particular implication seems less than ideal to me.\n        </p>\n    </section>\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Wait... How can that be?</contextual-heading>\n\n        <p>Well, this system is pretty complicated but below is a video summary of how it \"works\"...</p>\n\n\n        <div class=\"captioned-image\">\n            <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ac9070OIMUg\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>\n            The key point to \"realize\" is that in the old, plurality model, you cast <em>one vote per seat</em> and each vote is counted.  Voters are expressing preferences for <em>both seats</em>.  In this new model you express a bunch of stuff but only <em>one of your votes is actually counted</em> regardless of the number of seats.  That's the 'feature' designed to increase kinds of representation.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Concretely, this means that there's a calculated threshold and a particular means of counting in order to pass that threshold.  In this model, voters provide an order of support.  65% of voters will distribute their \"first choice\" vote among 3 candidates in our hypothetical <em>because they have to not because this accurately reflects what they would state is their preference in terms of all the seats</em>.  Alternatively, 35% will cast their first choice vote for the same person.  In a 2 seat race with 4 candidates, the threshold is 34%.  The only thing that is certain after the first round of counting is that the least desirable outcome for 65% of people has reached it and receives a seat.  There's no counting or transfer of second or third choices or surplus votes involved in that case:  All they had to do was turn out 34% for a single candidate people are passionate about.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            When you look at it in this light, the whole \"electability\" question isn't actually resolved either.  You're actually much more likely to prevent worse outcomes by ranking candidates that you think have a chance of passing the threshold but prefer to your least desired by ranking them artifically higher than your honest preference.  Why?  Because only one vote actually <em>counts</em> and it only counts in the sense of moving someone toward the threshold.  In the end, most of those \"expressed preferences\" don't actually wind up really mattering.\n        </p>\n\n    </section>\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So what can we do?</contextual-heading>\n        <p>\n            Well, two things: First, help me make sure that W3C membership really understands this.  Ultimately, how the W3C works rests on their shoulders.  If they want to see that changed, that can happen.  Either way, understanding how your votes are interpreted really matters.\n        </p>\n\n\n        <p>\n            I guess this is the part that actively worries me: While I understand the good intents, this actually seems like an awfully low bar to have outsized impact.  Perhaps I am simply overly sensitive to this based on events that I observe happening in the world around me, or biased based on the systems I am used to.  I'm willing to admit that that's a possibility.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            But, if you share my general opinion of least desirable outcome and also think that both of the 2 seats should really be filled by 2 of the other 3 candidates - what can you do?  Well, the  <em>most important</em> thing is to help turn out the vote.  Turnout is generally very low, and \"out of the box\" the default liklihood is that passionate supporters with 1 candidate are more likely to show up than people who see that 3 out of 4 candidates seem acceptable.  Thus, 34% is not a hard target.  But, the bigger the turnout, the more <em>actually reflective</em> a vote will be, and, I expect the harder it will be for a candidate with small, but strong support to reach the 34% threshold.  Even reducing this support by few percent has a radical impact on the results of the hypothetical above. This is entirely achievable.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            If you're an AC <em>vote</em>.  Whether or not you've voted in the past, please, please vote:  Every company's votes are counted equally - the 1 person shop that joined W3C gets the same voting power as Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM and other really big companies.  Each of you gets 1 vote that will be counted.  Make it count.  If you do, be sure to use the \"no other candidate\" option rather than implying any degree of support for a least desirable outcome so that when votes transfer they don't poorly impact.  Even if this doesn't ultimately wind up impacting the results, it helps inform the AB and system whether this result is desirable.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            If you <em>know</em> an AC (even if you are one yourself), please share this with them.  Make sure they see it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            If you are anyone else -- please share it on social media. Believe it or not, we're all wildly connected and you'd be suprised at how easy it is to bump into a connection who either is an AC or at least knows someone who knows one. Just, basically, help get the word out.  If you have an opinion, share it.  In the past few years, people with the power to vote have listened to what you've had to say and there's no reason to think we can't make them listen again.\n        </p>\n    </section>\n\n    <p class=\"thanksTo\">Special thanks to my friend, Chris Wilson for spending a <em>substantial</em> amount of time helping me understand the details of this voting system.</p>\n",

Most of the work that happens in the W3C happens under the banners of in either <em>Community Groups</em> or <em>Working Groups</em>.  Both of these formats are, primarily, designed to facillitate discussion in a way less encumbered by potential intellecutual property and patent issues.

When an organization joins the W3C, they must name an AC representative.  The AC Representative then is in charge of, as the name suggests, representing their organization in helping 'run' the W3C.  What this means, in practice, is that AC Representatives are, for example, the ones who say \"I release this person from my organization to particpate in such and such group, attend meetings, and work 'in the open' on standardizing what is in the charter\".

In some ways, you can kind of think of it as a steering committee for work and focus.

As both an avid user of them myself and someone involved in many discussions during their creation and evolution, I really want them to be better too.  As I speak to the folks who are frustrated, however, I find that there is so much there that it's difficult to discuss.  So, I thought perhaps it would be worth sitting down and writing about it.  That, and walruses.\n    </p>\n\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The time has come...</contextual-heading>\n        <div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-right\">\n            <img data-src=\"http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/pics/glass21.gif\" alt=\"\">\n                \"The time has come,\" the Walrus said,<br>\n                \"To talk of many things:<br>\n                Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--<br>\n                Of cabbages--and kings--<br>\n                And why the sea is boiling hot--<br>\n                And whether pigs have wings.\"\n        </div>\n\n        <p style=\"clear: none\">\n            Over the last few years, I've watched several observations and criticisms sprout up about Custom Elements.  It began (I think) with someone pointing out that there's an ability that is spec'ed today: The ability to extend native elements with the <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> attribute.  Extension, as the argument goes, is desparately needed for accessibility sake.  Yet, for some reason, it remains unimplemented.  This has generated a lot of discussion, frequently about who was to blame for holding the Web back and making custom elements less valuable.  Given this core premise, further arguments have been made as to how this would be good for so many additional reasons: Given X, then Y. Given Y, then Z.  In concert, all of these simple observations and arguments really do appear to lead inexorably toward a very simple and well-justified \"overall solution\" that would be really grand...If browsers would just get their shit together and implment the thing in the spec.  It's pretty frustrating to a lot of people.  I can appreciate that.\n        </p>\n\n        <p style=\"clear: none\">\n            I'd like to take some time and unpack a lot of this though...\n        </p>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Accessibility Magic</contextual-heading>\n            <div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n                <img data-src=\"/media/walricorn.jpg\" alt=\"walricorn t-shirt\">\n                <p>You can, and probably should, buy this amazing walricorn t-shirt on Amazon.</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <p>\n                Let's start here: The popular understanding that if we were to extend a built-in element it would be \"automatically accessible\" by the simple virtue of inheritance.  I think it's important to explan that this is very nearly entirely untrue.  Sadly, the magical walricorn won't actually magically bring all of the good little elements who used <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> free accessibility on International Walrus Day (November 24th).\n            </p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none;\">\n                Here's why: <em>Currently, all that accessibility goodness that we desire is inextricably wound up in the native DOM</em>. Sadly, the vast majority of use cases for \"improving\" a native element is actually about improving the DOM itself, and this creates a substantial mismatch.  In reality (not an opinion), as soon as we create a new shadow root or hide the existing element or do just about anything really useful to the user experience, all of that accessibility goodness largely just vanishes.\n            </p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none\">\n                Note: I say <em>almost</em> entirely untrue because there, in fact, are some small set of problems that involve no new DOM at all.  However, in terms of accessibility, many of these  also have similarly trivial solutions already available today and/or there are other proposals under discussion that promise to help solve these problems better.\n            </p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none\">\n                So, any concept that <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> will make all components more accessible is, sadly, just misleading. There's no magical affordance in extension that allows it to map \"whatever random shit I just made up\" to \"the thing with all of the good accessibility characteristics\".  You've still got to do a lot of work.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                What's more, this isn't really a controverial statement in standards land.  Hats off to Google for actually trying really hard to solve a lot of problems. For a brief instant, some people were very hopeful in the idea of <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code>.  Others saw too many problems and too little benefit.  That moment seems to have passed though and, realistically, no one seems to actively believe that  <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> holds a lot of answers.  Since that time, counter-proposals have been fermentingand, currently, appear to have wider conceptual support (I'll mention some of that later).\n            </p>\n\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Progressive Enhancement</contextual-heading>\n            <div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-right\">\n                <img data-src=\"https://www.exploringnature.org/graphics/mammals/walrus_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"an illustrated diagram of some walrus features\">\n                Walrus extends Animal.\n            </div>\n            <p>\n            While accessibility is commonly cited, I think that really it is the Progressive Enhancement (PE) that appears to be afforded by <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> that is probably the real lynchpin feature that really makes so many people latch on to this idea.  I can entirely appreciate this: It sounds so good.  Unfortunately, I think this is misleading as well.</p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none\">Here's something subtle to think about:  Is <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> really PE in the traditional sense?  Well, no.  It can't be since the ability to extend has never existed before. PE has traditionally never been an <em>is-a</em> relationship.</p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none; margin-top: inherit;\">Consider a common example used to explain PE: Our designs include a button that say \"click to print\" which should call <code>window.print()</code> when clicked.  PE says start basic with something that works for everyone.  In this case, it might be a paragraph saying \"Print this page for your records\".  Every browser is capable of doing that. Users can then often figure out how to print in their particular environment.  Then, if a user's browsers meets the requesite criteria (it knows what a button is, it supports JavaScript and <code>window.print()</code> is defined), then it <em>enhances</em>.  Seems good.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                But now consider the details: It might become a paragraph <em>containing</em> a functional button, or it might actually <em>become instead</em> a functional print button. Is that the same thing?\n            </p>\n\n            <div style=\"margin-top: 0\" class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n                <img style=\"width: 300px\" data-src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/d/db/Hubert_Carpenter_%28Earth-616%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20110609023559\" alt=\"A photo of Marvel's Walrus Man villian\">\n                <code tag-esc=\"\">man is=\"walrus\"</code>\n            </div>\n            <p>\n                Neither <em>turning one thing into something else</em>, nor <em>changing the composition of a thing</em> are really the same thing as <em>extension</em>. Traditionally, the \"ness\" of that element instance never changed.  In no case was the same thing both paragraph <em>and</em> button at the same time.  That's why you can't write <code tag-esc=\"\">p is=\"button\"</code> for example - it's nonsense.  However, the mere fact that this attribute would <em>allow</em> an author to express such a desire (meaning, someone can and will type that) means introducing a whole lot of new plumbing and complexity for new cases that have to be accounted for.\n            </p>\n\n            <p style=\"clear: none\">\n                However we spell it out, a paragraph and a button are two things that are just entirely different things in terms of heirarchy and that's the important thing, here's why...</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section style=\"clear: both\" class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Metaphorical Walruses</contextual-heading>\n            <p>\n                While you may think that the above \"paragraph that is a button\" example above seems \"really different from what you're asking for\" and is merely my contrived example aimed to convince you of something irrelevant, it isn't.  I would suggest that <em>currently</em> this is actually <em>precisely</em> what we are frequently asking for without even realizing it.  Why?  Well, again, that's because what we want actually usually involves new DOM.  It's not, <em>in terms available to us today</em>, actually just a specialized version of something. Really often, what we're describing is a different, and more complex kind of relationship.  <em>is-a</em> is very specifically about <em>extension</em>, and extension is about describing a taxonomy, like, in the Linnean sense.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                Understanding the basic ideas of Linnean Taxonomy is <em>obviously</em> very important to understand if you want to get a job as say, a marine biologist or a paelentologist. But what most people don't realize is that unlike some of the other frivolus things they made you learn in school, like, for example, algebra - understanding <em>this</em> can also come in extremely handy in everyday adult life.

So, let's talk about that for a minute.\n            </p>\n\n\n            <p class=\"sidenote\">\n                A really significant amount of western thought has centered around trying to divide up the world like this into kind of fragile and abritrary taxonomies. Author David Weinberger has written a lot about this tendency/history, his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43DZEy_J694\">Everything is Miscellaneous</a> is a really enjoyable and non-technical talk that is worth watching some time.\n            </p>\n\n            <div style=\"margin-top: 0rem\" class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n                <img data-src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9-lw3BD0Ama-3cUSOXA_J5l_d0=/0x0:404x303/1400x1050/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51386351/d200908311113466240.0.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of Barbara Liskov\">\n            </div>\n\n            <p>\n                In 1987 Barbara Liskov presented a keynote address called \"Data abstraction and hierarchy\" which talks about how we model things and our desire to organize things into heirarchies that <em>extend</em> and <em>inherit</em>. Liskov goes on to illustrate how that tends to cause numerous sorts of problems.  More importantly, she begins to explain how we might avoid those problems and the basic concept she describes is sometimes known as the \"Liskov substitution principle\" or \"LSP\" or even just \"substitutionality\".  In 2008 she won the Turing Award for her work.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                In a way, what she's saying is: Metaphor makes for shitty modeling.  Our <em>minds</em> are actually perfectly fine handling all sorts of wild linkages, comparisons and semantics that are more metaphorical than literal - in fact, they're kind of built to find patterns and relationships even when they don't exit.\n            </p>\n\n            <div style=\"margin-top: 0rem\" class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n                <img data-src=\"/media/walrus_cloud.jpg\" alt=\"Clouds that kinda sorta look like a walrus\">\n                Photo credit to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lostmycat/\" target=\"_blank\">Janie</a>.\n            </div>\n\n            <p>\n                Programming languages, on the other hand, tend to take things pretty literally.  Because of this, our minds can trip us up and make us model something poorly.  Extension is good and useful, don't misunderstand what I am saying.  But if we use it poorly then rather than being a really helpful abstraction, we'll find that the system will begin to fight us instead.\n            </p><p>\n\n            </p><p>\n                Once again, that's just what happens here: <em>Currently</em> all that \"good stuff\" that we want is bound up pretty tightly in DOM and therefore a lot of times when we're thinking \"is-a\" it's unfortunately more metaphaorical than literal.  <em>In terms currently available to us today</em>, it just isn't - and so we wind up modeling poorly.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                Being able to extend input \"like HTML did\" is one of the most cited use case examples that I hear for extension.  However, even in the platform itself, where extension was technically possible, there is no extension at play here today. There is only input.  It's worth noting that most of how <code tag-esc=\"\">input</code> was done is largely seen as <em>considerably problematic</em> by implementers today.  Why?  Well, the easiest way to begin to understand, I think, is by listening to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/176453149\" target=\"_blank\">this talk by Monica Dinculescu</a>.  In short though, it's really created by the model mismatch we've been discussing here.  Instead of being really helpful, the model begins to fight us.  We begin to see the cracks in our modeling of metaphor and that actually, it <em>isn't-really-that</em>.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                This mismatch is increasingly widely recogonized as a real problem that needs solving.  In the <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">Extensible Web</a> sense, there's a lot more magic currently woven into today's DOM that needs explaining.  In order for us to actually accomplish many of the sorts of things people are actually trying to describe, we need to decouple the powers and be able to explain the existing platform, and new things, in those terms.  There are a number of discussions underway that are aimed at helping us do precisely that, and none of them are simply inheritance or <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> as currently specified.  I'll write about those in another piece, but this leaves us with a very real problem:  Until then, where does that leave us?\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                Well, interestingly, in the meantime, 'is-a' isn't the only kind of relationship we have identified for modeling problems.  The often cited Gang of Four <em>Design Patterns</em> provides the simple observation \"composition over inheritance\" based on Liskov's work.  That is: Composing features through a <em>has-a</em> relationship is often a better way to go in the long run anyway.\n            </p>\n\n            <section class=\"sectioning\">\n                <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">We <em>has-a</em> way...</contextual-heading>\n                <p>\n                    The really interesting part is that absolutely nothing new is required in order for us to both follow the self-same progressive enhancement patterns that we've been using all along and gain pretty much all ofthe same values we would with <code>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> without adding any new complexity to the platform itself... How?  Through composition rather than inheritance. In concrete terms:\n                </p>\n\n                <pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!-- instead of writing this --&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"radio\" is=\"x-radio\"&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- you write this --&gt;\n&lt;x-radio&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"radio\"&gt;\n&lt;/x-radio&gt;</code></pre>\n\n                <div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n                <img data-src=\"/media/sax-walrus.jpg\" alt=\"a cool looking walrus playing the saxophone\">\n                Hat tip to my pal Bruce Lawson for this, you can also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0tmHaR0rCJ4\" target=\"_blank\">watch the video of this actual event involving a groovy walrus playing a saxophone</a>\n                </div>\n\n                <p>\n                    Yes, it's not perfect.  Yes, it's not exact pairty.  There are some cases where you have to progressively enhance a parent element in order to affect a child, for example.  However, if you take some time and consider this carefully, you'll find that in fact, their effects are functionally equivalent in just about every useful way: Form serialization, validation, etc.  Both are declarative and have about the same fault tolerance built into their pattern.  And, importantly: As a creator of a component using this pattern, you'll have to change and proxy precisely as much <em>in either model for the sake of accessibility, depending on just what DOM what you change</em>.  Because of this \"very close resemblance\" if you find any of these aspects very frustrating, it's worth noting that <code tag-esc=\"\">is=\"‚Ä¶\"</code> (as specified today) would likely create <em>many</em> of the same frustrations.  I realize that this can seem a little unintuitive, so I'll likely talk about the sorts of objections I've heard to these observations in another post.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    So, to sum up: We <em>has-a</em> way forward for now through composition.  It's not a bad way at all.  It's actually quite powerful and good.  It isn't perfect.  It isn't complete.  But we <em>can</em> do a lot of useful things and that's a Really Good Thing‚Ñ¢.  The fact that we've largely stopped chasing <em>is=\"‚Ä¶\"</em> isn't due to simple stone-walling by any vendor and it isn't a net loss.  Ideas need to be able to spread and percolate with lots of minds.  The original ideas also need to be able to fail if they aren't fit so that ideas can mix and mutate and ultimately better ones can arise.  That's just what I see happening here.  In near future pieces I'll write about what sorts of ideas <em>are</em> actively being chased down to help us better solve these problems instead.\n                </p>\n\n            </section>\n    </section>\n\n    <div class=\"captioned-image optional\"><img data-src=\"/media/john-beatle.jpg\" alt=\"photo of John Lennon\">\n    goo goo g'joob...</div>\n\n    <p class=\"thanksTo\">\n        Special thanks to my friends, Alex Russell and Peter Rushforth for proofing/commenting on early drafts of this piece and helping them be shorter and less confusing.\n    </p>\n</section>",

In my last post <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Listen-Up.html\">You Don't Say: Web Speech APIs Part III</a>, I talked about the recognition interfaces: <em>listening</em> or <em>speech-to-text</em>.</p>\n\n  <script src=\"../prism.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"../test/listening/basic-voice-listener.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"../test/listening/pausable-voice-listener.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"../test/listening/VoiceInputElement.js\"></script>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../prism.css\">\n  \n  \n\n  <p>To sum up the state of things with recognition:</p>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>It's <em>much</em> less widely implemented and deployed than Text-To-Speech (TTS).</li>\n    <li>Like TTS, it is not an 'official' standard. Browsers are working on it, but not much work seems to be happening 'together' on this anymore.</li>\n    <li>It requires special privileges</li>\n    <li>Its API is kind of confusing</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <section class=\"sectioning\">\n    <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">What's wrong with the current APIs</contextual-heading>\n    <p class=\"note\">These are just my personal opinions after using it a lot for the past couple of months.\n    Sometimes eating the dogfood gives you new perspectives and nothing in this should be taken as a\n    criticism of the brave souls that worked hard to bring us what we have.  It's easy to forget that we're standing on their shoulders. Hats off to them.</p>\n\n    <p>Let's assume that the API worked consistently, as advertised by the existing draft, across browsers and on all devices. The trouble with is that I see is mostly just that it doesn't \"fit\" in the Web platform today.  It's not really a high level API, nor is it quite the low level we probably need.\n    </p>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n      <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Imagine...</contextual-heading>\n      <p>When I hear \"voice recognition\" or \"speech to text\", this implies to me that I can take a sound,\n          analyze it and turn it into a transcipt of text.  When I watch a demo and I see someone speak into the mic and words come out on the screen, I have the same impression.  I get excited and begin thinking of the possibilities. Yes, I want that.  Think of all the things I could do with the ability to turn sounds of spoken word into text - I begin to imagine...\n          </p>\n\n          <ul>\n            <li>I turn the directory of podcasts I've downloaded into text. I could do lots of interesting things with that, skim them for example to see if I want to listen.  Better still, I can index them and hyperlink them.. I can make a word cloud... I can search for things that were discussed without trying to remember what was said about Web Components in .. hmm some a podcast? or was it a talk? It was Jeremy Keith... I think? Last year maybe? In fact, I don't even have to have watched it to know that.</li>\n\n            <li>Speaking of podcasts, I've been thinking of doing one.  Imagine I'm in a studio with 4 other people all with their own mics.  It'd be super neat to identify them by name and capture their transcribed text in a simple transcript.  Hey, that's kind of like meetings.  I attend a lot of meetings that aren't minuted.  We could fix that.</li>\n\n            <li>I have a thing that lets me upload a video to a website I maintain... I know that for accessibility sake I need captions of this video and that has to be in Timed Text Markup Language (TTML).  Wow, that's a pain in the ass to write from scratch.  I could write a thing to take the audio track, turns chunks of it into text, inserts that into TTML and uploads me a draft in my workflow that I can then simply proof, correct,  approve and publish.  We can't do that with this API either.</li>\n\n            <li>I also had an idea for simplistic, hands-free conversational assistant for while I am driving - kind of my own simplified Jarvis.</li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <p>But there's the rub, none of these are actually easily accomplishable with the current API for various reasons, and mostly simply because it is kind of hard-wired toward that sound coming from the mic without really exposing that.</p>\n\n          <p>This is a shame because since <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a> (EWM), we've worked very hard to help \"explain the magic\" already burried in features of the platform and focus our initial efforts on the powers that are fundamentally new. As far as I can tell, really the only thing in these APIs that is fundamentally new is the idea of an interface for transcibing audio of speech into text.  Things like promises, web audio, media devices, fetch and streams are all things we've worked on and that can potentially be used to help explain just about everything else in this API.  As the speech draft predates all this, it's no suprise that none of that is taken into account, but it's not too late.</p>\n\n          <p class=\"note\">In fact, the authors of the spec did recognize some of this and there are notes in the spec and errata that link to, for example <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-speech-api/2012Sep/0072.html\">this observation</a> with the thought that perhaps it was too late for this draft, as it is actually a 'final report' and not an official spec.  I hope we have room to revisit this.</p>\n\n          <p>Let's use this as an exersize to start low and build up the concepts we want, as each level affords new opportunities for people to dream up things we weren't even considering.\n          I've <a href=\"http://bkardell.com/blog/Prognostication-And-The-Failure-Of-The-Web.html\">written about this before</a>, but it's astonishing how many creations that are fundamental things today turned out to <em>not</em> be what their inventors even thought they would be. Houses were originally wired for artifical lighting  - there were no plugs, because there was nothing to plug in.  While we were busy standardizing bulbs, an astonishing flourishing of inventions and whole new industries were created by the simple fact that we gave people electricity.\n          </p>\n      </section>\n\n\n      <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">A 'low-level' transcription interface</contextual-heading>\n        <p>Let's imagine that we started simply with the idea of an API that gave us just the fundamentally new part: Something that takes some audio and gives you back the transcribed text.  Accessing your filesystem or your mic are things that require permission, but what we're talking about here doesn't itself do that, so that's not even something we need to worry about.  Actually, asking for analysis of something could be modeled after the HTTP request/response model, and that seems kind of fitting because there's potentially some variance in the response.  For example, different implementations can definitely have different interpretations of the same sounds.  So, let's start with the common model of being simple async and transactional, pass/fail things that we deal with via promises and resolve some kind of response...something like:</p>\n\n        <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// let's save bikeshedding a name for another day...\nlet transcriber = new FictionalTranscriber()\n\ntranscriber.transcribe(someAudioStream).then((response) =&gt; {\n  // we'll talk more about this\n})</code></pre>\n\n        <p>That's pretty straightfoward I think. A transcriber has a <code>response</code> and an error is handled with the promise's <code>.catch</code> method.</p>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n          <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">Results</contextual-heading>\n          <p>While the current interface you get these wonky array-likes which default to having exactly one\n          item in them, but let's kind of work backwards and see if we can avoid this.. Imagine that the response itself simply contains the properties <code>.transcript</code> and <code>.confidence</code> (from the existing APIs).  Then the default 'just give me your best guess' case is as simple as:</p>\n\n          <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let service = new FictionalTranscriber()\n\ntranscriber.transcribe(someAudioStream).then((response) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`\n    I am ${response.confidence}% confident\n    that I heard \"${response.transcript}\".\n  `)\n})</code></pre>\n\n          <p>The existing APIs also contain a separate event called <code>onnomatch</code> that is\n          different from <code>onerror</code> in that it's more about it receiving\n          something and processing it but not being able to confidently enough\n          deterimine what was said. It seems that what we mean to say is \"we recognized nothing\" or\n          \"we heard something but what it was is undefined\".  In both cases these have\n          programming concepts for these: The null string (\"\") or, in JavaScript we also have <code>undefined</code>.  In JavaScript are falsey - so I think we can get rid of that extra event\n          entirely with something as simple as saying that that is a possiblility...</p>\n\n\n        <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let transcriber = new FictionalTranscriber()\n\ntranscriber.transcribe(someAudioStream).then((response) =&gt; {\n  // if we didn't match anything sufficiently\n  if (!response.transcript) {\n     console.log(`Sorry, I didn't catch that`)\n  } else {\n    console.log(`\n      I am ${response.confidence}% confident\n      that I heard \"${response.transcript}\".\n    `)\n  }\n\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n          <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 3rem;\">Alternatives</contextual-heading>\n            <p>\"Ah,\" you're thinking, \"but those arrays are meaningful... One of them contains N possible 'alternatives'\".   True, but alternative to what even?  This seems like a strange use of the word anyway.  Conversely, our model could also allow our response to contain an <code>.alternatives</code> array beyond our best guess transcript.  By default, it would be empty because there are no alternatives.

Let me explain...</p>\n\n            <p>What we are providing what is, effectively, a service interface.  We're not saying how the actual\n            transciption should be done.  There are an astounding amount of challenges there.  There are lots of different existing remote services with lots of different qualities, lots of different APIs and lot of different sorts of inputs. A want to figure all of this out will stall a process for a very long time and be, ultimately, as much about politics and sway as actual merit.</p>\n\n            <p>On the other hand, if we simply say \"Here's what it has to look like on the client, and the client should include a default implementation\" we have to agree to very little.  While this seems like it isn't giving you 'much', the adoption of this simple pattern would provide the standard we most desparately need:  All we have to agree on at this stage is what the client interface looks like.</p>\n\n            <p>There are some other practical upshots to this too.  The first is that we can also make that extensible by defining basic API lifecycle methods and allow competition and variance to play itself out very easily and employ lines of thinking we can't easily consider in a standards body.  Imagine, for example, that Google's cloud platform could release a subclass:</p>\n\n            <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">export default class FictionalGoogleCloudTranscriber\n  extends FictionalTranscriber {\n    // override\n    request: (audio) =&gt; {\n      // return some promise that meets the expected API\n      return fetch(....).then(...)\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n          <p>The only thing that changes is which one you instantiate - they all work, at the API level, the same way.  This means that these adapters are then as easily distributable as jQuery plugins and Amazon can compete with Google and Microsoft and Mozilla and... well... anyone while we figure out </p>\n\n          <p>This also fits very nicely with allowing us to experiment with the remaining (seemingly unimplemented) ideas in the APIs (like <em>grammars</em>) and provides room for us to work things out.  Eventually, perhaps we can derive a higher level protocol allowing us to express things as simply as:</p>\n\n          <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let transcriber = new FictionalTranscriber({\n  serviceURI: 'blah',\n  grammars: whateverThisIs\n})\n\ntranscriber.transcribe(someAudioStream).then((response) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`\n    I am ${response.confidence}% confident\n    that I heard \"${response.transcript}\".\n  `)\n})</code></pre>\n\n            <p>Importantly though, this means we don't have to wait for that day and we can be part of the solution in figuring out what it should be.</p>\n\n            <p>Interestingly, there was <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QRajFwBdV82aTnPCQNKOfL2ZGkyfG9X9ZfCYgK2xstk/edit\" target=\"_blank\">another proposal</a>, also from someone at Google\n        more recently that is considerably closer to this idea.  However, that idea\n        seems to have not gone far.</p>\n          </section>\n        </section>\n        </section>\n      </section>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n          <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Low Level <em>First</em>, Not Exclusively</contextual-heading>\n          <p>The idea isn't ever to stop at the low level APIs.  It's not even that we\n          absolutely positively have to have the low level APIs entirely in place.\n          As I explain in <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Tao-Of-The-Extensible-Web.html\">What Would Bruce Lee Do? The Tao of the Extensible Web</a>, in some cases we can come back and expose details of a carefully designed black box after the fact.  At a minimum, describing the API in common platform terms and the thought exercise of what a suitable low level API would look like allows us to design the boxes and\n          layers carefully.</p>\n\n          <p>For example, given such an API as described above, it <em>would</em> make sense to add a\n          higher level API which made use of it and exposed it... A pattern which explained\n          the common lifecycle of grabbing a device, getting permission, listening to a channel, chunking that input, sending it to the transcriber and ultimately pumping out transcripts.  Perhaps something like..\n          </p>\n\n          <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Here we create an object not entirely unlike what\n// the API already had - it defaults to being initialized\n// with the audio context/primary mic, sends a chunk\n// of sound to our transcriber and relays the promise\n// results or errors to events\nlet speechRecognizer = new FictionalSpeechRecognizer()\n\n\n// event based methods relay promise results\nspeechRecognizer.onresult = (evt) =&gt; { /* evt.response.transcript */ }\nspeechRecognizer.onerror = (evt) =&gt; { /* evt.error */ }\n\n// the audioContext is exposed: You can control it\nspeechRecognizer.audioContext.start()\nspeechRecognizer.audioContext.stop()</code></pre>\n\n        <p>The general idea being that we can answer the questions \"what's under there?\"\n        by saying \"it has an audio context and a transcriber\" and we can expose those\n        for extensibility... For example, we could allow you to swap out the transcriber\n        implementation without forcing you to reimagine any other part in the system..</p>\n\n         <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let speechRecognizer = new FictionalSpeechRecognizer({\n  transcriber: new FictionalGoogleCloudTranscriber()\n})</code></pre>\n\n        <p>Or if you can get an audio context another way (say, one of N line inputs, or from a file),\n        you can swap that out easily without forcing you to reimagine anything else either..</p>\n\n        <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">let speechRecognizer = new FictionalSpeechRecognizer({\n  audioContext: someAudioContext\n})</code></pre>\n\n        <p>Given such an explanation, we could easily experiment with further layers, floating ideas as\n        custom elements.  For example: An <code tag-esc=\"\">input</code> decorator that could progressively\n        enhance an textual form controls to allow you to populate them with speech.  All you'd need\n        to say is 'they have one of those speech recognizer things and provide a toggle that pipes\n        voice to it and the output back into the field'.. Something like this.. </p>\n\n        <pre><code class=\"language-html\">\n&lt;x-voice-listener&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"input\"&gt;\n&lt;/x-voice-listener&gt;\n        </code></pre>\n        <x-voice-listener>\n            <input placeholder=\"How can I help?\">\n        </x-voice-listener>\n\n        <p>That's kind of interesting because there were <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20090308033937/http://www.voicexml.org/specs/multimodal/x+v/12/spec.html\">specs trying to do something like that\n          back to the early 2000's</a> and it seems to be where Google restarted the converstaion in 2012 as well.  We could figure that out, and do it with real world experimentation and testing! As you can\n          see from this super rough demo, there's a lot to think about.. Should there be an attribute to\n          autostart? Should it automatically stop?  Should other attributes be present? <code>paused</code>, for example? I don't know, but we could try a lot of things and see what works.\n        </p>\n        </section>\n      \n\n\n      <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So now what?</contextual-heading>\n        <p>Since there's something implemented on Chrome and Android, you have a lot of\n        0's in the number of machines that actually support the existing API.  As with\n        a lot of 'new' features on the Web, you'll probably want think about how you can use\n        progressive enhancement for a lot of use cases... In some cases, the API is\n        good enough that you can paper over its kinks and that might be 'good enough'.</p>\n\n        <p>Unfortunately, the low-level API sketched out in this document isn't possible\n        to achieve <em>using the existing Speech APIs</em> because they don't provide adequate explanations\n        or hooks. Fortunately, however, it is entirely plausbile to make this API real\n        today using a remote service that conforms to a design like this.  Such services that transcribe\n        sounds of speech to text are plentiful - Google's Cloud Platform and Amazon both\n        provide APIs capable of achieving this for limited purposes would be free enough\n        to experiment with and prove out, and fairly low cost beyond that.</p>\n\n        <p>I have a kind of rough POC that I'll be building out, for purposes of demonstrating ideas to limited groups, but wide publicly sharable demonstration is potentially cost prohibitive (unless some vendor\n        wants to donate free time).  However, if you have a business use for this,\n        perhaps it's worthwhile.  If you're interested in helping out with that,\n        or hearing more, let me know.</p>\n      </section>\n\n  \n\n  <p class=\"thanksTo\">Special thanks to my friend, the great Chris Wilson for proofing/commenting on pieces in this series.</p>\n\n",

In my last post <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Basic-Voice-Speaker.html\">You Don't Say: Web Speech APIs Part II</a>, I talked about how I'm personally papering over what\n    we \"have\" today with regard to making the browser \"talk\" and why. In this post I'll talk about the other end of that: <em>listening</em> or <em>speech-to-text</em>.</p>\n\n  <script src=\"../prism.js\"></script>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../prism.css\">\n  <script src=\"../test/speaking/basic-voice-speaker-ii.js\"></script>\n  \n  \n\n  <p>So far we've been talking about the unoffical Web Speech APIs in terms of speech as <em>output</em>, or text-to-speech. As I've said, this is actually supported to some degree in all modern browsers. But now we're going to talk about the other end of\n    things: Speech as input or \"voice recognition\" or, if you prefer \"speech-to-text\". This is currently <em>not</em> widely supported - in fact, only Chrome has a \"working\" implementation popularly deployed, but it is available in FirefoxOS and available\n    behind a flag while they work out some permissions issues and reportedly under development in Edge as well. It's a much harder problem in general, and there are a lot of gotchas here too. In this piece, I'll cover a lot of them.</p>\n\n\n  <section class=\"sectioning\">\n    <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Let's get started</contextual-heading>\n    <p>Ok, so first things first: <code>webkitSpeechRecognition</code>. This is the thing that makes recognition possible. There are a number of really good articles that will tell you that you should have a line that looks something like this:\n    </p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nconst SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.mozSpeechRecognition || window.msSpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;\nconst recognition = new SpeechRecognition();\n            </code></pre>\n\n    <p>I'm going to recommend, however, that you don't and here's why: Because we're just not far enough along to pretend we know what a compatible and standard <code>SpeechRecognition</code> will look like or that there ever will be any of those others.\n      This is an approach that used to common, but that has changed and at one point we thought it was a really keen idea. Unfortunately, this interface arrived in Chrome just about the time that we began to admit to ourselves what a problem this creates.\n      You'll note that nobody likes to ship vendor prefixed stuff anymore in the release channel, and here's part of the reason why: When everyone writes code like the example, it assumes that they aren't experiments or that they must be identical. Purposely,\n      the original idea was that you could have a <code>webkitThingy</code> and a\n      <code>msThingy</code> and a <code>mozThingy</code> and those were <em>experimental</em>. That is they might be totally different, competing experiments or simply be used to write tests and practice in order to inform what the real standard would\n      be. However, in practice, the use of such patterns as the above tended to actually cause that to not be the case at all. There were 'first mover' advantages and 'market share' problems. Once we get even a couple reasonably popular uses of this API,\n      the experiment now wags the standards dog because there's lots of code depending on it matching things it wasn't intended to. Both ECMA and W3C TAG have had much discussion on this problem.</p>\n\n    <p>So, let's just be honest with ourselves and err on the side of caution and say: It's the <code>webkitSpeechRecognition</code> API at this point, and that's all we can say with absolute certainty. If we get truly interoperable implementations, how\n      hard will it then be to go back and change that one line? Pretty easy, I expect.</p>\n\n    <p>Ok so, with this in mind, we could re-write the above as:</p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nconst recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();\n            </code></pre>\n    <p>\n      But this is just creating an interface for you, it's not <em>actually doing</em> anything yet.\n\n      </p><section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Events</contextual-heading>\n        <p>In order to actually do anything with it, we're going to want to tell this recognizer what we actually want from it via attaching some listeners to it. There are a lot of events that we can plug into, as you will see below but in practice I haven't\n          personally required many of them.</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li><code>audiostart</code> \"Fired when the user agent has started to capture audio.\"</li>\n          <li><code>soundstart</code> \"Fired when some sound, possibly speech, has been detected.\"</li>\n          <li><code>speechstart</code> \"Fired when the speech that will be used for speech recognition has started.\"</li>\n          <li><code>speechend</code> \"Fired when the speech that will be used for speech recognition has ended.\"</li>\n          <li><code>soundend</code> \"Fired when some sound is no longer detected.\"</li>\n          <li><code>audioend</code> \"Fired when the user agent has finished capturing audio.\"</li>\n          <li><code>result</code> \"Fired when the speech recognizer returns a result.\" </li>\n          <li><code>nomatch</code> Don't worry about this one for now, we'll come back to it.</li>\n          <li><code>error</code> \"Fired when a speech recognition error occurs.\"</li>\n          <li><code>start</code> \"Fired when the recognition service has begun to listen to the audio with the intention of recognizing\"</li>\n          <li><code>end</code> \"Fired when the service has disconnected\"</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>A few of these are self explanatory in terms of their lifecycle: Starts have to occur before their corresponding ends. However, one could be forgiven for wondering, for example, \"which happens first according to these descriptions? audio start\n          or sound start?\" To answer your question, let me just quote the spec:\n\n          <span class=\"spec-quote\">Unless specified below, the ordering of the different events is undefined. For example, some implementations may fire audioend before speechstart or speechend if the audio detector is client-side and the speech detector is server-side.</span>\n        </p>\n\n        <p class=\"note\">If you're thinking to yourself: \"Wow, that seems potentially really confusing and hard to work with,\" same.</p>\n      </section>\n\n\n      <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Methods</contextual-heading>\n        <p>\n          The recognition object also has 3 methods in charge of whether it is actively listening and feeding things to the above events:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li><code>start</code></li>\n          <li><code>stop</code></li>\n          <li><code>abort</code></li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          If you're wondering what the difference between <em>stop</em> and <em>abort</em> is, it's actually pretty simple.: Stop means stop listening, but not stop processing and feeding any pending events to its listeners. Abort is a hard disconnect\n          of all the things.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <p>So, at it's most basic: You create a recognizer, add some listeners and call <code>.start()</code> and you should get some results until they are again disconnected (we'll come back to that in a moment)</p>\n\n      <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Starting up</contextual-heading>\n        <p>Before we set up an example, it's worth explaining that this feature is \"different\". <em>Playing</em> some media is something that has been a part of the Web for a really long time, it's not something that requires a special permission. But\n          <em>listening to your microphone</em> is different, as it should be. That's something that the user has to explicitly give permission for and be made aware when it's happening. As such, when you call <code>.start()</code> Chrome will ask the\n          user if it's ok for this website to use the mic. Keep in mind, they could well say \"no\" so you'll want to prepare for that eventuality - it will call the error handler with the <code>event.error</code> property of <code>not-allowed</code>.</p>\n\n        <p>Even this, however, is incomplete. \"Ok to access the mic\" is a pretty 'simple' answer, but it's far reaching. If I want to be able to click a field and speak into it (like Google search on Android), does that mean I am also giving permission to\n          listen to the conversations in the room at all other times as long as there's a tab open? That sounds terrible in most use cases, but there are use cases that are kind of almost that. This is tricky to manage, as you can imagine, so the draft\n          and implementation say that the UA (browser) has to indicate to the user when it is and isn't actually listening and it has to stop when the tab is no longer active. This can take a few different forms, and we'll come back to that - but generally\n          speaking, Chrome on the desktop will (currently) give a user two indicators that distinguish the difference between these two things.</p>\n\n        <div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"background-color: inherit;\">\n          <img src=\"../media/mic-permission-granted.png\" alt=\"\"> Once the user has given permission, in the right of the address bar, it will say it is accessing the mic. That doesn't mean actively listening for speech.<p></p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"background-color: inherit;\">\n      <img src=\"../media/actively-listening-to-mic.png\" alt=\"\"> Once we actively start listening, in the tab itself, it will show a red \"recording\" dot. This dot will disappear when we stop.<p></p>\n    </div>\n\n    <p class=\"note\">I personally have trouble believing that the average user will really understand the difference without some training which could happen the first time the mic permission is granted or something, but I've never seen. I'm also not entirely sure how\n      this translates for someone who can't actually see the screen, for example. This is interesting, because that is actually the default assumption on mobile so, on Android it will play audible listening/done listening tones. I'll come back to why\n      this too is currently imperfect, but let's move one.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n      <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">The most basic example</contextual-heading>\n      <p>Alright, so now you know what to expect, as a user and we know basically what the API looks like, let's talk about code.</p>\n\n      <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nconst recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition(),\n      basicExampleOut = document.querySelector('#basicExampleOut')\n\nrecognition.onerror = (evt) =&gt; {\n    if (evt.error == 'not-allowed') {\n        basicExampleOut.innerText =\n            `I can't listen if you don't grant me permission :(`\n    } else {\n        basicExampleOut.innerText =\n            `Whoops I got an ${evt.error} error`\n    }\n}\n\nrecognition.onresult = (evt) =&gt; {\n    // What is this crazy thing?!

Unfortunately, it is not a true <code>Array</code> (very sadly since other things in the TTS portions covered in previous articles are) but another weird array-like thing called\n          a <code>SpeechRecognitionResults</code>. By default, it will have exactly one item. It contains, in turn, individial <code>SpeechRecognitionResult</code> objects.</p>\n\n\n        <p>So just what is a <code>SpeechRecognitionResult</code>? <em>By default, its basically also an array-like with just one item</em> called a <code>SpeechRecognitionAlternative</code>. Wait what? I know, it seems weird, but stick with me...</p>\n\n        <p><code>SpeechRecognitionAlternative</code> is really the 'thing' that you want and <code>.transcript</code> is the text it transcribed from what it heard on the mic. This object also has property called <code>confidence</code> which is a numeric\n          value between 0 and 1 representing how confident the recogntion system is that it got that right.</p>\n\n            <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nrecognition.onresult = (evt) =&gt; {\n        // evt.results is an array-like collection of\n        // SpeechRecognitionResult objects\n    let speecRecognitionResults = evt.results,\n\n        // it's a collection of exactly one by default (see below),\n        // but that is also array-like\n        speechReognitionAlternatives = speechRecognitionResults[0]\n\n        // but that also contains by default exactly one\n        alternative = speechRecognitionAlternatives[0]\n\n        // and _that_ thing has all the properties\n        console.log(alternative.transcript)\n\n}\n                            </code></pre>\n\n        <p>You are undoubtedly thinking \"Wow, why all the complexity?!\" To understand this, you need to note that several times above I said \"by default\". That's because the draft also provides for other use cases and we really need go no further than this\n          next property/example to see why..</p>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 3rem;\">Max Alternatives</contextual-heading>\n\n            <p>The recognizer we set up has a property called <code>maxAlternatives</code> which is a numeric value indicating how many alternatives we're willing to receive. Let's take the following example:</p>\n\n            <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nvar recog = new webkitSpeechRecognition()\nrecog.maxAlternatives = 10\nrecog.onerror = (evt) =&gt; {\n   debugger\n}\nrecog.onresult = (evt) =&gt; {\n   let alternatives = Array.from(evt.results[0])\n   alternatives.forEach((result) =&gt; {\n      console.log(\n        `\n        confidence: ${result.confidence}\n        transcript: \"${result.transcript}\"\n        `)\n   })\n}\nrecog.start()\n            </code></pre>\n\n            <p>If I run this in Chrome, on my desktop mac, and then say \"Tutu\" it will log something <em>like</em> this:</p>\n            <pre><code class=\"output\">confidence: 0.7706348896026611\ntranscript: \"tutu\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9056409001350403\ntranscript: \"two two\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9139654040336609\ntranscript: \"to to\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9311671257019043\ntranscript: \"2 2\"\n\nconfidence: 0.933784008026123\ntranscript: \"- 2\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9352703094482422\ntranscript: \"too too\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9483599662780762\ntranscript: \"22\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9183915853500366\ntranscript: \"TuTiTu\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9120156168937683\ntranscript: \"to 2\"\n\nconfidence: 0.9352703094482422\ntranscript: \"tu tu\"</code></pre>\n\n                <p>If, however, I run the same code and say \"Desmond Tutu\", I get only a single result:</p>\n                <pre><code class=\"output\">confidence: 0.9614496827125549\n        transcript: \"Desmond Tutu\"</code></pre>\n                <p>So, as you can see, speech can be ambiguous and depending on the quality of the implementation of the thing transcribing speech and the amount of context you hand them, the quality of the mic and the voice/pronounciation/accent of the speaker, they may be able to, or want to give you alternatives if they can't be very sure.  And - well - if you're into that sort of thing and prepared to deal with that yourself, that's pretty cool.</p>\n\n                <p>Ok, but what about that <code>SpeechRecognitionResults</code> thing... Why is <em>that</em> an array-like??  Why do we still grab the first one in that last example?

In any case, it's unspecified currently how it will work <em>without</em> a grammar or entirely how those should work and <em>in practice</em> in Chrome I was unable to find any difference at all whether you set it or not, so again, little point in saying more about it here and now beyond that.</p>\n\n        </section>\n\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n      <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Wrapping up</contextual-heading>\n      <p>So, it's interesting.

In my last post <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Greetings-Professor-Falken.html\">Greetings, Professor Falken: Web Speech APIs Part I</a>, I talked about the existing APIs we \"have\" for speaking (as well as why the air quotes) and all the many ways that they are wonky today.  In this post I'll share some of my own opinions on that API, as well as how I'm dealing with the <em>speaking</em> part IRL.</p>\n\n    <script src=\"../prism.js\"></script>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../prism.css\">\n    <script src=\"../test/speaking/basic-voice-speaker-ii.js\"></script>\n    \n    \n\n    <p>So, we have these wonky APIs implemented inconsistently in a lot of browsers.  We know how to deal with that, we've done it before.  I'd like to review our options to explain how I think it makes sense to approach this:</p>\n\n    <ul id=\"options\">\n        <li>We could just monkeypatch something which makes these precise APIs (or at least some subset) actually work consistently in all browsers.  It's way too early to consider doing this in my opinion and probably does more harm than good as we begin to eliminate options for real implementations/standards.  Let's not do that.</li>\n        <li>We could develop an alternately named polyfill which does just that - instead of dealing with <code>speechSynthesis</code> for example, you'd deal with <code>_speechSynthesis</code>.  That could be interesting, but I'm not sure the API is actually that great to begin with as I'll explain below, so maybe that's not a great option at this stage either.</li>\n        <li>We could develop a new proposal with its own \"speculative polyfill\" or \"prollyfill\" following <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/polyfills/#advice-for-polyfill-authors\">excellent advice by the W3C TAG</a> in how we do that and <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">#extendthewebforward</a>. This seems very plausible, but I think we're getting kind of ahead of ourselves even there.</li>\n        <li>We could make some libraries following the same advice that hope to become proposals after initiating a lot of discussion and showing that they are, in fact, pretty well thought out and handy.  This is where I think we are.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">What's wrong with the current API?</contextual-heading>\n        <p><em>Note: These are just my personal opinions after using it a lot for the past couple of months.</em></p>\n        <p>Let's assume that the API worked consistently, as advertised by the existing draft, across browsers and devices.  Would it be what we really want or need.  I think that, actually, the answer is no.  </p>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">How low can you go?</contextual-heading>\n            <p>On the one hand, it's intending to be a low level API, but here I feel like it still falls a little short.  Speech is sound, and yet it's not clear to me how this really fits into the audio architecture.  There was very brief disussion of this, but to not seems like a failure to me.  For example, here's a nifty demo from MDN that allows you to <a href=\"https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/\">add effects to your voice with input from the mic</a> by connecting it to an audio stream which gets processed to add things like reverb.  However, the draft nor implementation seem to have no way to intercept the audio stream generated by <code>speechSynthesis</code>.  This seems like a shame because the set of things that you could do there is nearly unbounded, whereas the set of things you can do with the existing levers is exceptionally finite.  In my own use cases, I really wanted those abilitites.  Similarly, the most handy of them (pitch, rate, volume) overlap.  Surely there is something 'down there' that deserves explanation.  If these were done 'in post' there's no reason that any voice shouldn't support those.  So, I think we need more there.</p>\n\n            <p>It seems to me there could easily be an 'audiocreated' callback or something which gave you a chance to deal with the audio itself instead of just piping it to the speakers.</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Off to the races</contextual-heading>\n            <p>Ok, so it's not the low-level API I'd like it to be, but there's a lot of room for improvement at higher levels too...</p>\n            <p>As I explained, <code>.getVoices</code> is weird.  It's kind of typical Web weird in that listeners for events like <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> are also historically racey.  The rationale, I believe, is that remote voices may or may not be available and that can actually change through the duration of your program.  If you've ever used Google Maps Navigation you might have heard the speech change - I beleive that's what's going on there.  But it feels like we should be past this as we have had <code>Promises</code> for some time and the two can co-exist.  Most of the time what we really want to know is \"have some voices loaded or not\" and managing and guarding against that seems unnecessarily complicated.  You can't put something into the queue with <code>speechSynthesis.speak()</code> until you have an utterance.  You can't create an utterance until you have voices.  You can't simply grab voices because they might not be loaded yet, you can't listen for voices to change if they <em>are</em> already loaded and, in theory, even once something is queued you could lose it before it is actually processed.</p>\n            <p>This is a lot to ask the average author to understand how to get right in my opinion.</p>\n            <p>It seems to me that since we can't 'speak' without a voice, whatever logic you are going to use to choose a voice from the available set should be available to the queue itself so that it can choose at the moment just before creating the audio.  This would solve a whole lot.  It also seems to me that <code>speechSynthesis.speak()</code> should return a promise representing completion or failure of the whole transaction (basically, end or error).  For many common cases, this is all we really care about and is kind of analogus to the fact that XHR contains many 'shades of gray' status changes, but the most successful AJAX abstractions had a simpler pass/fail promise on the entire transaction.</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Immutable?</contextual-heading>\n            <p>The fact that you create an instance of an utterance and then set properties seems to lead to a lot of confusion, it's kind of hard to read too.  It definitely seems to me that it would be very handy for it to take an options/config object like <code>MutationObserver</code> and then be immutable properties. Generally speaking, I'm not sure what you would hope to 'do' with an utterance once it has been created except put it in the queue or take it out of the queue and having it present you with an API that throws at some times and not others seems to be begging for classes of problems we don't really neeed.</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Reuse</contextual-heading>\n            <p>Think for a moment of the choice of voice, the pitch, rate and volume as a \"speaker\".

Other vendors have since shipped parts of mostly the same API despite it not being on a formal standards track.</p>\n\n        <p>The draft contains a number of errata and the implementations don't all agree entirely.  Since it's unofficial and a Note, they aren't really updating the draft and making it better isn't exactly the highest priority.</p>\n\n        <p>There's some more good news in that this is a fairly low-level interface, allowing us to experiment atop it and inform standards, <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/\">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a> style.

If anyone has called <code>speechSynthesis.pause()</code>, whatever you add to the queue won't get spoken until it is unpaused, and then it is subject to coming after whatever is already in the queue, no matter where it came from. I'm not going to demo this as it's likely to only cause confusion, but if something suddenly isn't working and your browser supports speech, try running <code>speechSynthesis.resume()</code> in the console and see what happens.</p>\n\n        <p class=\"note\" id=\"pause-on-android\">If you're on Chrome on Android, this probably didn't work, worse - if you go back, run the first example, it won't work either.  <code>.resume()</code> doesn't actually seem to work.

If <code>.onError</code> is called, the event it raises will have an <code>.error</code> attribute (or, it's supposed to) which should be an error code indicating why.  The draft lists <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/webspeechapi.html#speechsynthesiserrorevent\">11 'kinds' of problems</a> and they are both informatice to the kinds of things you should be thinking about, but some of these don't seem to happen IRL and leave undefined spec behavior gaps.</p>\n        </section>\n\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 3rem;\">Expressiveness</contextual-heading>\n            <p>Speech is complicated if you want it to seem natural. In my <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/The-History-Of-Speech.html\">History of Speech</a> I link to a recording of Bell Lab's Voder in the 1940s demonstrating the many ways one might intone the phrase \"she saw me\".  Similarly, since we're just using strings of text, we're theoretically subject to all of the sorts of potential problems about ambigious strings. For example given the string \"12/4 = 3\" we'd probably like that to be pronounced \"twelve divided by four equals three\" whereas we might like \"12/12/2012\" to be pronounced like \"December twelfth, twenty twelve\".</p>\n\n            <p>The first bit of good news is that all of the speech synthesis implementations I've tried actually do a <em>pretty good job</em> using punctuation to inflect and pause and frequently can deal with a lot of those problems automatically... For example, all of the below pronouce sensibly for me without further effort:\n\n                        </p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">speechSynthesis.speak(\n  new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(`\n    1.

To some, this is unacceptable.  The first example in this document purposely misspelled the name of Professor <em>Falken</em> from <em>War Games</em> because the best guess sounds like an expletive.  To wit, in my history article I also point to several \"official\" standards that were developed in the W3C to deal with just these sorts of problems.  I'm mentioning this here because the Speech API says that the text provided to an utterance can be one of these: A well-formed <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/\">SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) document</a>.  SSML lets you express all kinds of stuff.  This would allow you to create a single utterance which varied all sorts of things throughout and let you express how you wanted each bit to be said.  The spec gives implementations a way out saying that if the implementation doesn't support SSML, they have to just take the text content.

All the implementations I've looked at will actually try to pronounce all the markup.  That's bad.  I suggest you just avoid that.</p>\n\n            <p>The really good news though is that you can actually achieve a lot of the same amount of control by doing your own processing/creation of utterances.</p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section class=\"sectioning\">\n            <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 3rem;\">Language</contextual-heading>\n            <p>Utterances also have a <code>.lang</code> property which you can set.  It has to be a string representing a <a href=\"http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt\">BCP 47 language tag</a> (like en-US). If you don't set it, it will by default be the language of the document.  This can give hints to pronounciation.

The idea is that you could find a voice in the set and use it to make it sound nifty.. Let's look at an example using a voice called \"Bubbles\" to speak the lyrics of a song by Jack Johnson:</p>\n\n                <pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">\nlet voice = speechSynthesis.getVoices().find((voice) =&gt; {\n    return voice.name == 'Bubbles'\n  }),\n  lyrics = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\n      `It's as simple as something that nobody knows\n       That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes`\n  )\n  lyrics.voice = voice\n  speechSynthesis.speak(lyrics)\n                </code></pre>\n                <template><script>\nlet voice = speechSynthesis.getVoices().find((voice) => {\n    return voice.name == 'Bubbles'\n  }),\n  lyrics = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(\n      `It's as simple as something that nobody knows\n       That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes`\n  )\n  lyrics.voice = voice\n  speechSynthesis.speak(lyrics)\n                </script></template>\n                <button class=\"run\">Run this</button>\n\n                <p>Did it work for you?  Hard to know because, here's the bad news: The list of voices you get back will vary depending on the browser and OS pretty wildly.  On my mac I get a list of 60 voices in Safari v7 (don't ask), 43 voices in Chrome v60, and 24 voices in my Firefox Developer Edition.  This voice doesn't exist on my current Chrome on Android.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"note\"><em>Worse still though</em> the shared <code>speechSynthesis</code> on Android means that\n                it's going to speak in whatever voice was last chosen - pretty much anywhere.  If you ran <em>The Godfather</em> example just before this on Android, it probably just spoke those lyrics in an Italian accent.  Sweet.  Just kidding, this is terrible and caused me many many problems.</p>\n\n                <p class=\"note\">Setting the <code>.voice</code> attribute on the utterance might be what's documented, and it might even be what we just (probably?) successfully ran, but what you've got to set if you want it to work in Android  is the <code>voiceURI</code> attribute on the utterance, which isn't even listed in the list of attributes in the draft or most documentation I've read.  Sadly, neither seems to work for me univerally, so set both if you're choosing a voice... And... good luck finding a way to select a good voice. Finally, not all voices support modification of things like rate and pitch.\n                </p>\n\n                <p class=\"note\">Another quick note about the <code>.voiceURI</code>: \"Bob\" is a valid <code>URI</code> reference. So is the empty string.  A <code>URL</code> is a kind of <code>URI</code>.  So, basically what I am saying is: It could be pretty wildly variant, and it is, even for voices with the same name.</p>\n\n            </section>\n        </section>\n    </section>\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n        <contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">Wrapping up</contextual-heading>\n        <p>So...

It allowed a (very skilled) operator to create human-like voice with inflection. It was pretty impressive and demonstrated that we'd gotten our heads around a lot about generating human voice-like sounds with electronics.  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0rAyrmm7vv0?t=26s\" target=\"_blank\">It sounded like this</a></p>\n\n\t\t<p style=\"clear:none\">This work continued to evolve  and by the early 1960s, Bell Labs was synthesizing speech on an IBM 704 and were able to demo it singing the song <a href=\"https://youtu.be/41U78QP8nBk?t=1m4s\" target=\"_blank\">Daisy Bell</a>, which inspired Arthur C Clarke's HAL in <em>2001 A Space Odyssey</em>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But, like a lot of things at Bell Labs, this was just way way ahead of it's time.  The rest of the world just needed to really catch up.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>When I was born, to most people, computers were mostly the realm of seemingly far-future science fiction movies.  Actual life was pretty analog.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top:0; clear: both;\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"http://www.boxcarcabin.com/rca-xl100-console-tv.jpg\">\n\t\t\tHere's what my television looked like when I was 4\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>Back then, you had to get up and walk across the room to change the channel, and you'd do it by physically turning a dial or two and maybe manually moving around an antenna. The year I was born they started selling consoles like Atari Pong. But those were still weird clunky things that you controlled with dials and analog buttons, just like the television.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-right\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"../media/TeleGames-Atari-Pong.jpg\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>By the time I was old enough to remember anything, a number of 'toys' were beginning to put together some really interesting things: Texas Instruments had the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvPAS6W3q78\">Speak And Spell</a> released in 1978.  The same year, Mego Toy Corp released the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icqHuRDjGRU\">2-XL</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p style=\"clear:none\">Note all the differences in those two.  The 2-XL sounded human, because it was. The Speak and Spell sounded digitized, because it was.  Lots of ideas were developing and merging and crashing into one another.</p>\n\n\t\t<p style=\"clear:none\">The movie \"War Games\" introduced me to modems, AI and Text-to-Speech. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9l5jSDL50&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19s\" target=\"blank\">YEs, <em>his computer... spoke</em></a>.  The idea of networked computers which could actually sort of 'converse' made my head swim.  It's probably what ultimately drove me to ask for a computer.  Sadly, it didn't talk.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What did get better and better at talking though was games.  I won't go through them all, but in 1991 two things occurred. Sega introduced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnvs5B_8ISo\">Joe Montana Sports Talk Football</a> which spoke full sentences and announced the game as played.  Wow.  Also, the Web was born, without much fanfare as a very simple, linkable text thing (and I mean very simple - no styles, no images, forms or buttons, no scripting, no tables even).</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Since the Web...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p style=\"clear: none;\">As time went by and computers and software got more and more powerful we continued to chase the dream of making them speak and able to be spoken to.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Dragon Naturally speaking let you 'talk to your computer' in the form of dictation.

They even <em>exposed it in their web browser via embeddable objects that you could control with vbScript</em> (as long as you used Microsoft).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>With Microsoft having demonstrated it, it seemed very plausbile we might get speech in the browser 'for real' very soon.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In 1998 <em>CSS 2</em> included Aural Stylesheets. Ever heard of them?  They don't work.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>In March 1999 AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent, and Motorola formed the VoiceXML Forum to create a kind of 'HTML, but for speech'.  One year later they took VoiceXML to the W3C and a whole bunch of other organizations got involved.  Most of them did not make a Web browser.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/voice-intro/voice-intro-fig1.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>What resulted was not just a codified VoiceXML, but the W3C Speech Interface Framework composed of: Voice XML 2.0, Natural Language Semantics Markup Language, Speech Synthesis Markup Language, Speech Recognition Grammar Markup Language, and N-gram Grammar Markup Language.

Then, one day in 2010, a W3C Community Group called the \"Speech XG Incubator Group\" was started with a developer from Google saying \"some of us at google have been working on extending HTML elements for speech\".  It was right around this time that Siri was introduced to the wider world and a new era of digital assistants began to flourish and evolve. </p>\n\n\t\t<p>But, what followed was... mostly boring.  It was requirements gathering.  Lots of people saying \"I think it should X\" or \"It has to Y\" and \"No, I disagree because Z\".  That's... unfortunately how standards in committees work.  ,</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But quickly, and I mean <em>very</em> quickly Google submitted a <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html\">proposed draft</a>.  Through all of the discussion, they also got <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0023/speechrequest.xml.html\">a proposal from Mozilla</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Mar/att-0003/htmlspeech_tropo.html\">another from a company called Voxeo</a> and, finally <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2011Mar/att-0001/microsoft-api-draft-final.html\">one from Microsoft</a>.  It's worth noting that none of these is 'an official proposal' by W3C terms.  But, in the end, the result of this Community Group was a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/live/NOTE-htmlspeech.html#proposals\">Note</a>, effectively, \"Here's what we found and what we recommend developing\".</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The final step here involved <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2012Apr/0010.html \">whether this work should move now into a real Working Group</a>.  But that didn't happen.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What did happen, was the creation of another Community Group led by Google and the statement on April 3, 2012, \"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/groups/proposed/#speech-api\">Google plans to supply an implementation</a>\" of a limited subset of the recommendations of the first group.  You see, the requirements and proposals were, like other standards predecessors, very involved and complicated.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Google <em>did</em>, in fact, supply an implementation and wrote an article talking about \"HTML5 Speech APIs\".  This raised some ire because, in fact, it is not part of HTML5, nor was it even on a standards track, it was technically still \"just some stuff people were discussing very seriously\" in the Community Group.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>There were people from smaller orgs, and just general folk -  at least one or two people from Microsoft and Mozilla, but the conversation on the mailing-list was really mostly dominated by people working at Google.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In the end though, the product was a <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/9a0075d25326/speechapi.html\">Final Report which laid out another API, which is, again not on any standards track.</a></p>\n\t\t<p>One might think that the rise in popularity and utility of digital assistants would really spurn the interest in standards bodies to move this forward, but instead it seems to have largely \"stalled\", which is kind of a shame because the web <em>kind of is</em> the ultimate digital assistant in many respects already...

Despite all this history, there are nevertheless, bits of implementation of the unofficial proposal in <em>every modern browser</em> and much of it isn't even behind a flag or prefix!!  In fairness, none of them follow it exactly, and to an extent it's hard to say what \"it\" even is since the spec, out of band errata and implementation shipped by Google don't entirely match.  Further, it's kind of wonky even across different OSes for the same browser and whether you're connected to the interwebs or not.  It's very much like DOM/CSS support in 1998 or 1999.  But, because it's unofficial, addressing issues is typically pretty low priority.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In some sense though, which is the more valuable 'standard' - the unofficial stuff everyone has implemented or the official ones written down that aren't?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I'll explain a lot more details, including gotchas and bits I find problematic in the <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/bkardell.com/blog/Greetings-Professor-Falken.html\">pieces I set out to write initially</a>.

Founded in 1994 along with the inventor of the Web Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it is a member based consortium originally modeled after the X-Consortium, with the stated aim of helping to \"lead the Web to its full potential\".  Its 465 \"member orgs\" are various types of organizations, foundations<a href=\"#footnote1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, academia and companies.   In late 2011 a movement in Web Standards began to take shape - seeking to help reform the things that many of us thought were broken.  This meant creating a common/shared vision across <em>several standards</em> bodies, changing ideas about where successful and lasting standards come from and how they are made and really stressing the importance of Web developers (who weren't themselves members) to that equation.  Lots and lots of positive change has happened at many levels, and lots more progress <em>toward</em> change has been set into motion but isn't yet complete and - if you'd like to see it continue, we could use your help.</p>\n\n\t<p>Everything about how it works is based on a series of rules codified in a thing called \"The Process Document.\"  You can sort of think about them as \"the laws\" that govern the W3C.  It's boring, I know, but it's crucially important if you want to really affect change to how the W3C works.</p>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">I'm Just a Bill: An analogy</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>In the US, if you want to change or pass a law, it begins with a Bill.  A bill is effectively, the text of the proposed change.  If it can get a number of individuals in Congress to support it, it can eventually go to the Congress for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" vote.  Most countries (even localities and the United Nations) have similar concepts, but they use different terminology.  So, incase the analogy/terminology is a little too culturally biased, here's a fun primer that a lot of US children saw when I was growing up that explains the ones I'm using:</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\" id=\"s\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"‚Äùnoreferrer\" noopener‚Äù=\"\"><img src=\"/media/justabill.jpg\" alt=\"\">Click for video of Schoolhouse Rock's \"I'm just a Bill\".</a>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>In many ways, the W3C doesn't work dissimilarly: If you want to change the the way that the W3C really \"works\" you ultimately need to change the \"laws\" (the Process Document itself).  Assembling a proposed \"bill\" begins with drafting a legitimate proposed change and building a number of co-supporters and taking it to the \"congress\" for consideration and a vote.  In W3C terms, the \"congress\" are called the \"Advisory Committee\" - more specifically, the \"Advisory Committee Representatives\" - one per member organization.  A large number of these members are assembled once per year at the W3C Technical Plenary And Committees meeting (TPAC).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>An Advisory Committee Representative's job is to officially liason between W3C and individual member organizations.  They are the one person empowered to \"represent\" their organization in an official capacity, including delegation to name people to working groups, sign off on IP policies, and... to cast their vote on things like a proposed change. </p>\n\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Meta-Election</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Within the W3C, the job of managing all of this - getting a \"bill\" together with a number of co-sponsors, building some support, bringing it to the \"floor\" at TPAC answering questions and so on so that it can come to a vote is placed upon a group called the \"Advisory Board\" (or AB). The AB also plays an important advisory role to  the W3C staff itself on strategic issues.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In deep, and deeply nerdy ways, the AB is important if you want to affect fundamental changes.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The AB is itself is a (mostly) elected group of nine people. So, if you want to affect real, substantial and lasting \"process\" changes at the W3C, the first stop is the AB.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Battles Won</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>For most of the history of the W3C, all of this was \"inside stuff\" - that is, outside of the W3C, it was unknown.  But then, around 2012, we began appealing to Web developers to help make our desires known under the pretense that, like Congress, membership to some extent must represent you.  Without your support and adoption, they have very little - and it's worked.   In nearly every election, \"reform\" has progressed and the opposition has slowly diminished. Groups like the AB have increasingly come to better represent us - they've also gotten more diverse and slowly, but surely things we have made substantial progress.  The W3C is more interested in developers, in outreach, in how to include our voices.  Incubation of ideas that includes developers is one thing that our AB have successfully advocated.  Because of our efforts, even the quality of candidates who run has improved.  But we're not there yet.  As you can imagine, getting substantial change through is a long, dull and arduous process.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Currently, there is an election underway for the Advisory Board.  4 of the 9 seats are up for grabs and it once again falls to developers to show up and advocate if we want things to continue.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Here's Who I Support, and why..</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Each of the seats that are up for election have incumbent candidates, but we have 7 candidates for only 4 seats. You can have a look at all 7 <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2017/05/02-ab-nominations#nr\">official candidate statements</a> made to the ACs asking for their votes.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>For the most part, I believe that most of the new candidates will be less successful toward the aims we've been supporting - worse: Progress is much more easily lost than gained.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Except for one: Natasha Rooney.  Natasha has been involved in numerous standards bodies and for quite a while she has stood out to me as someone who would be a great asset to the AB.  I've personally encouraged her to run in the past, but the timing just wasn't right.  But now, she is.  To the best of my knowledge, she was the first (and I believe currently still the only) new candidate to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thisNatasha/running-for-the-w3c-advisory-board-b2eaf918445\">publicly post a statement</a> which I believe speaks for itself.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That's why I believe that the strongest slate of 4 is both largely stable and includes Natasha.  After a lot of consideration, I most strongly support these folks for AB:</p>\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Mike Champion</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Chris Wilson</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Natasha Rooney</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Judy Zhu</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<p>\n\t\tIt may surprise some that this list doesn't include Charles McCathie Nevile as I have actively campaigned for him in the past.  I'm thankful for his contributions and efforts and I'd actually largely happy for all of them to be re-elected.  He's a good friend and I greatly respect all that he does.  I'm not specifically opposing him, but the reality is that there are only 4 seats and, as he says in his statement:  He's been there longer than anyone else and he does a crazy lot of other important stuff for the W3C.  Given all this, this might be a great time to introduce some new energy and give him some space to focus on those other roles for a time.  At least, that's what I think would be the best receipe for most success right now.  This W3C election will also include a form of preferential voting, which is an effort he championed for a long time and is now in place, so ACs can be quite expressive with their own votes.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">So what do I do?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>It's this simple:  Share your support of whomever on social media.

This is true in designs and meetings as well as practically in code: CSS Selectors can be used by DOM, programatically, and by CSS declaratively to 'talk\n\t  about' something in terms of function or style.</p>\n\n\t<p>ARIA provides a way for you to explain to the browser that a thing <em>is</em> or <em>behaves as</em> something it can understand. For example, an element can have a <code>role=heading</code> or <code>role=button</code> and the browser will expose that\n\t  to AT appropriately. This works because native elements have <em>implicit roles</em> as defined <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/\">ARIA in HTML</a> and ARIA defines a rich taxonomy for explaining these.</p>\n\n\t<p>Now, however, let's say we want to talk about headings, or buttons. For us, verbally, that's trivial. For AT, that's trivial. But in terms of CSS selectors, it's kind of a pain in the ass. Let's say that you want to style \"the first letter of any paragraph\n\t  immediately following a heading\" and you've got a number of approaches across your site(s). Traditionally, to write this, you'd have to write:\n\n\t  <code></code></p><pre><code>h1 + p::first-letter,\nh2 + p::first-letter,\nh3 + p::first-letter,\nh4 + p::first-letter,\nh5 + p::first-letter,\nh6 + p::first-letter,\n[role=heading] + p::first-letter { ... }</code></pre>\n\n\t  <p>Eventually, we'll be able to use the <code>:matches</code> to make this a little better: </p>\n\n\t  <code><pre>:matches(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,[role=heading]) + p::first-letter { ... }</pre></code>\n\n\t  <p>But.. that still isn't super great and that's kind of a trivial thing to want to express. The thing is, the browser <em>already knows</em> they're all headings, it's just invisible to us for many practical purposes. If they were exposed to us somehow,\n\t    we could write a simple rule like. </p>\n\n\t  <code><pre>[role=heading] + p::first-letter { ... }\n\t</pre></code>\n\n\t  <p><em>Note, the syntax there is debatable - practically speaking it would probably make more sense to use a pseudo-class like <code>:role(heading)</code> for this purpose.</em></p>\n\n\t  <p>It's not limited to headings either - the taxonomy is useful in a lot of ways. Take buttons for example. If you wanted to generically talk about the style of \"things that are buttons\" - traditionally you would have to write something like:</p>\n\n\t  <code><pre>button,\ninput[type=button],\ninput[type=submit],\ninput[type=reset],\nsummary,\n[role=\"button\"] { ... }</pre></code>\n\n\t  <p>But, again, the browser already knows that these are all \"button\", so it seems almost tragic that you can't just write something like:</p>\n\n\n\t  <code><pre>[role=button] {\n  background-color: #ccccff;\n  border-color: blue;\n  border-radius: 0.25rem;\n  display: inline;\n  border: 1px;\n  margin: 0.25rem;\n  padding: 0.5rem;\n  font-size: 0.8rem;\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}</pre></code>\n\n\t  <p>and that would apply to.. you know.. all the buttons. And for buttons, we do a lot - we style the hover state and the focus state and so on.</p>\n\n\t  <p>Now... I think that maybe this matters more than just \"it feels nicer to write\" because the simple fact is that without something like this, the data seems to show that we resort to workarounds.  For example, the Bootstrap <code>.btn</code> class, which ultimately leads to lots of things that are not accessible, and <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/Divs.html\">ultimately just 'less'</a> in pursuit of something that is pretty easy for authors to express.</p>\n\n\t  <section>\n\t    <h2>So here's a thing...</h2>\n\t    <p>This is <a href=\"../role-reflect.js\">a little script</a> written using mutation observers that you can include in the head of your document and it will expose the implicit roles defined <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/\">ARIA in HTML</a>      (if there isn't a role already). While you might think that is 'heavy', it simply looking at the tag name, doing a lookup and potentially setting an attribute - not really terrible at all.</p>\n\n\t    <p>The point isn't \"we should use this\" it is simply to give authors kind of enough to play with things and see if it's totally nuts or potentially really helpful <em>for authors</em>. If not, then maybe a way to begin to discuss what that might mean\n\t      in terms of a real solution.</p>\n\n\t    <section>\n\t      <div role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 1.4rem;\">Demo..</div>\n\t      <p>This page is, itself a demo. You can see lots of buttony things styled with a rule about buttons and headings all styled purple with rules just like the above...</p>\n\t      <button>Test button</button>\n\t      <input value=\"Test input\" type=\"button\">\n\t      <input type=\"submit\">\n\t      <input type=\"reset\">\n\t      <div role=\"button\">Test ARIA Btn</div>\n\t    </section>\n\n\t  </section>\n\n\t  <section style=\"background-color: #e1e1f6; padding: 0.05rem 1rem 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.9rem;\" class=\"sectioning\">\n\t  \t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Post Script</contextual-heading>\n\t  \t<p>While writing this I thought I recalled a nearly similar thing come up a few years back, and even reached out to some folks to see if I could find it, so I didn't mention it.

As sometimes happens when I am writing, I have a semi-random but kind of related thought that doesn't really fit in the post and I tweet it instead.  As it got some little attention/discussion, I'd like to expand on it here and offer a little more explanation/context.</p>\n\n\t<p>Yesterday I tweeted a tweet about divs...</p>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I wonder, seriously, if it was a mistake to make the meaningless element &lt;div&gt; only 3 characters long. Would we abuse it less if it was long</p>‚Äî –≤–∫Œ±—è‚àÇŒµ‚Ñì‚Ñì (@briankardell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briankardell/status/843917216533925888\">March 20, 2017</a></blockquote>\n\t<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\t<p>I'd like to share some context on that.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>Let's imagine that you have a small contract to create a website whose whole aim is just to collect data.  It's really just a few simple forms.  If you wrote vanilla HTML without CSS for that and showed it to your client your client would probably immediately begin the search for your replacement.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>It looks abysmal really.  Unprofessional even.</p>\n\n\t<p>And it's not just potentially complicated things like layout - even simple things like buttons look pretty terrible \"out-of-the-box\" by today's standards.  From what I observe in practice it seems that a lot of people have decided that the default UA stylesheet is just kind of a terrible starting point for lots of things that we do.</p>\n\n\t<p>So we turn to something like Bootstrap.  Include Bootstrap's CSS and it immediately looks better.</p>\n\n\t<p>Surpringly to many at first though is that it doesn't look <em>that much</em> better.  Your buttons, for example, don't look like those fancy Bootstrap buttons.</p>\n\n\t<p>That's because those \"buttons\" are actually painted based on classes.  If you want your <code tag-esc=\"\">button</code> element to look like a Bootstrap button you have to add classes ala <code tag-esc=\"\">button class=\"btn\"</code>.</p>\n\n\t<p>Now, before I talk about any more of this I want to stress something:  <em>Bootstrap is a tool.</em>  Tools want to be generally purposed - able to be used to solve many problems.  Tools and parts kind of don't care what you do with them, they just are.  Sparkplugs, batteries, wires and gasoline are all perfectly wonderful tools and parts and with them you can build lawnmowers and tractors and go carts and semi-trucks and - well, all sorts of useful things.  You could also plug those things together directly and blow yourself up.</p>\n\n\t<p>Bootstrap is a perfectly useful tool that you can use to build wonderful things.  I'm not against it.</p>\n\n\t<p>In fact, a great thing about something like Bootstrap is that it comes with some pre-defined and useful vernaular that doesn't exist in native HTML.  The concept of a <em>primary</em> button for example. UIs frequently have a concept of a \"primary\" action. In our forms, \"submit\" or \"next\" is probably the primary action.  In an email client or chat client \"send\" is primary.</p>\n\n\t<p>The promise of CSS is really dependent on having more than just tags to work with. Part of the problem is that the standard vocabulary is quite limited and left to our own devices we'll just be all over the map.  Many of us won't even think about the idea of \"primary\".  The advantage of having some common \"slang\" with some good meanings like this is clear - people get in the habit of thinking about and identifying the \"primary\" action and marking it up as such.  Just like the default UA stylesheet, Bootstrap gives it some kind of visual treatment \"out-of-the-box\".  You can see how people appreciate this and how that isn't a bad thing at all.</p>\n\n\t<p>Where I have seen this really bite us is when those things aren't entirely clear and we combine that with an over-dependence on tools.  Tools <em>like Bootstrap</em> (this isn't unique to Boostrap in any way) enable people who don't know much about HTML or CSS to build a pretty nice <em>looking</em> sites and it's easy to take that a little too far.</p>\n\n\t<p>So, the thing is: Bootstrap will let you attach those button classes to absolutely anything.  Most of the time, the right answer is probably <code tag-esc=\"\">button class=\"btn btn-primary\"</code>.</p>\n\n\t<p>Here's why:  The <code tag-esc=\"\">button</code> element is suprisingly full featured:</p>\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/button-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t<div>The humble <code tag-esc=\"\">button</code> is focusable, clickable, touchable and smartly integrated with DOM events, by default looks 'buttony', has the potential to integrate with form/HTTP automatically, has an accessible role and label and has <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/proposing-css-input-modality\">quite a lot of smarts about how focus rings work</a> and more - all \"built in\" - and this is an incomplete list.  Buttons also have built in concepts like the ability to disable them and well-established meaning for that on all of these things.</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>However, all too frequently, once a project is already completed I find something like this instead <code tag-esc=\"\">div class=\"btn btn-primary</code>.  Look, semantics are weird. Sometimes this can lead to you asking weird philosophical questions about which element you really should use and there isn't always a clear answer.  But that tweet and this observation aren't a slam on <code tag-esc=\"\">div</code>s either: They're a perfectly useful 'container' structure.  You can use them to build structures that you can reason about more easily in your CSS and JavaScript. You should use them. I do. They just have absolutely no \"meaning\" at all - and in this particular case, it isn't really an especially philospocal question.  Point to the thing on the screen and say \"this thing\" and immediately most people will say \"the button?\".  It's a button.</p>\n\n\t<p>When you use a <code tag-esc=\"\">div</code> instead of a <code tag-esc=\"\">button</code>, all of those things sketched above go out the window.  You've got a lot of problems.  It might \"appear to work in a demo with the CEO\" but there's lots of issues that are harder to demonstrate and explain and that's a terrible situation to be in.</p>\n\n\t<p>Frequently, this isn't noticed until it's spread like a cancer.  Buttons are one of the most fundamental building blocks of UI.  You can't throw a stone without hitting a button, so remediating this late means touching your code in lots and lots of places. It might sound like a simple search/replace will fix you right up, but actually, those are quite different elements.  Subtle differences chase you, and you'll be suprised at how many bugs will keep coming back from your QA department if they're doing their job well.</p>\n\n\t<p>So, in the posts I'm currently failing to write I'm pondering the things that enable/reinforce us getting into these types of situations and why they are so terrible to find yourself in... and how to avoid them.  It seems pretty evident to me that the gap is in large part about presentation and the power of 'demonstration' to shape things - but that's for those other posts....</p>\n\n\t<p>What isn't clear to me at all is why so many developers seem to turn to a <code tag-esc=\"\">div</code> in the first place instead of defaulting to using a <code tag-esc=\"\">button</code>?</p>\n\n\n\t<p>That's kind of a mystery, and all I can do is speculate.</p>\n\n\t<p>One possibility is that perhaps if you think they \"seem equivant\" - one is shorter and looks less redundant?</p>\n\n\n\n",

It started with Jon Neal <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/774\">(re)opening an issue</a>.  This issue <em>seems</em> to be about a new element - but it's not entirely.  There were lots of comments and there was lots of discussion on lots of github issues in lots of repos.  I wrote <a href=\"https://bkardell.com/blog/On-Headings.html\">a piece</a> about my own complex thoughts about this issue.  It <em>seems</em> to suggest I am arguing that we start something brand new.  My friend Jake Archibald <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2017/do-we-need-a-new-heading-element/\">wrote a piece too</a> which <em>seems</em> really different than the other two.  Trying to keep them all straight and read through comments, one would think that there is a lot of disagreement... But here's the thing: I don't think there really is.  I think it's just really complicated to follow.  To this end - I've asked a few people if this is a fair summary and the answer seems to be pretty much \"yes\"... So, if you're looking to understand in fairly straightforward terms what the discussions are, here it is...</p>\n\n\t\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">FAQ</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<dl id=\"faq\">\n\t\t\t<dt>What would happen if we could flip a switch?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>If there were a switch that we could flip tomorrow that would enable the document outline as described to be switched on on the existing web, in some cases, the heading levels communicated on existing websites would change in screen readers.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>That's it?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Yes.  It could potentially enable development of new affordances which could be better, but that happens in the future, if it happens.</dd>\n\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Would this be better for existing content, or worse?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Very hard to say universally since we haven't actually tested \"it\".  In theory, the feeling from the accesibility community is \"generally better\".</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>\"In Theory?\"  \"It?\"</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Yes, there are a few problems here... First, there's not exactly an \"it\" we can flip on.  There are a lot of words in a lot of places and a few implementations (polyfills and tools, not browsers) that don't exactly match any of those words. </dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Wait... why don't they match?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>In practice it was difficult and confusing to match the words.  There was occasionally some feeling that what it was producing was not entirely great.  So, there are a few variant interpretations.</dd>\n\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Wow!  Why haven't we sorted this out?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Mostly, it's just been really hard to do so far.  There is a lot of speculation as to why, but we need to collect more data on that.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>We should do that, right?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Collect the data?  Yes.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>No, but shouldn't we work to switch something very like \"it\" on?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Maybe.  Probably.  It's hard to say, we don't even know why it hasn't been done yet... and not everyone agrees on the \"it\". _We need data, and we need experiments_.  It may be the easiest path from a standardization/paperwork standpoint to modify one of the existing sets of words in a spec.  But then, effectively we are redefining it again so I'm slightly wary of calling it an existing \"it\". Hard to say.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>What's the challenge?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well, aside from we don't have a perfect \"it\" to discuss, first there is a correlary problem that not all change happens simultaneously IRL.  What really happens is that for some time there is ragged support.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>The second is that each \"it\" encourages some amount of \"new advice\" on how to write to really take advantage.  If you write code <em>that way</em> then in some cases there is general concensus that in many cases the result will be worse on the unsupporting browsers than if you had done nothing \"new\" and just kept doing the same old same old.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>The third is that having an outline enables new possibilities for anything that uses AT, where \"AT\" can be thought of as anything that consumes content non-visually (and that is a big/increasing bunch of stuff) that go beyond \"some heading levels change\".</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>So, in at least some sense, it's about managing all that.</p>\n\t\t\t</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Ok, so what can we do?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We can work on figuring out what \"it\" should actually do in practice.\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>We can speculatively polyfill and test the variations of \"it\" to produce document outlines such that if you include the polyfill you can go ahead and write \"the new way\" and everyone will get the same levels and we can use this to discuss/test any \"it\".  The \"existing web\" will remain unaffected until we have a clear \"it\" and some browser implements it.</p>\n\t\t\t</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Seems good?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Yes.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Should we do that?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Yes.</dd>\n\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Have we?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>Kind of, but not really.  We have various levels of approximations of existing and new \"it\" ideas.  We need to work better on collecting together existing data and using experimentation to improve the main idea.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>So is 'it' a new tag?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>In most of the existing specs/words it is not.  Some custom elements exist which do some reasonable approximation of a subset, and they use a new tag.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t<dt>Are you suggesting that 'it' should be a new tag?</dt>\n\t\t\t<dd>The simple answer is: No not necessarily. Personally, I would rather see that if given the choice.  I explain in some detail why in my post.  I recognize this is my personal choice and it could be wrong.  We need some time and data to know, in my opinion.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t <dt>Can we just polyfill exactly as in the spec, not as a new tag?</dt>\n\t\t\t <dd>Yes! Well, probably.  As long as 'it' is polyfillable - and we should!  As soon as we figure out which spec and why - or are we going to change the spec to match one of the tools implemntation's approximations because they are more reasonable?</dd>\n\n\t\t\t <dt>Hmm... Can we try both (as a new tag and not)?</dt>\n\t\t\t <dd>Yes, and that is what I am suggesting is worth doing.</dd>\n\n\t\t\t <dt>Well... Which one will we standardize?</dt>\n\t\t\t <dd>Who knows?  Maybe neither.  Maybe both.  It's not an argument for or against.... More importantly - does it matter?</dd>\n\n\t\t\t <dt>Wait, what? </dt>\n\n\t\t\t<dd>\n\t\t\t\t<p>What I mean to say is: Until we have an actual standard, guessing is actually not a great reason to use them.  Don't let this hang you up.  This is a source of a lot of frustration historically in the Web community - we think we are promised things and then don't come.  We believe too much in words that are written down.  When one browser implements it, pay attention.  When two browsers do, it's more likely.  And so on.  We're just not there yet and we don't know what's going to happen. </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>In the meantime: Here is a thing.  You can use it if you want because it may be useful.  Or don't.  Here is another.  One may be more paletteable than the other or something.  For you, maybe one has really important features.  Using h1...h6 oriented polyfill will 'degrade' to a flat bunch of h1s without JS - but a lot of other ARIA isn't going to work well for you since a bunch of it requires JS.  </p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>The truth is:  <em>We just don't know</em>.  What we know is that you have a problem and one of these might help you solve it.  If not, how come?  If so, well done.  That's the job, right?  Get shit done.  Go spend some time with some \"it\".  Come back and tell us what you think and that will be helpful information.</p>\n\t\t\t</dd>\n\t\t</dl>\n\t</section>\n",

Personally, I like it that way, I find it more engaging and I prefer for people to read it that way.  However, for users on a metered or slow connection, downloading unnecessary images is, well, unnecessary, potentially costly and kind of rude.

Headings being the way they are, for example, has caused seemingly no end of discussion.  I'd like to explain why I think this is, as well as what we should do about it.</p>\n\n\t<p>Let's talk about paragraphs.  You can't get much more basic than a paragraph. When I say \"paragraph\" pretty much everyone will know immediately what I mean.  While some of us might stumble a bit if pressed to describe it abstractly, most of us will, like the US Supreme Court surely \"know it when I see it\". <span style=\"display:block; margin: 1rem 0 0\">Most people reading this, for example, will recognize immediately that this sentence is in its own paragraph.</span></p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">If it walks like a duck...</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Except that the above sentence isn't its own paragraph. Kind of.  Let me tell you a story that will help explain the disconnect...</p>\n\n\t\t<div style=\"margin-top: 0\" class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/angry-sea.jpg\" alt=\"George Costanza 'The sea was angry that day my friends'\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>You see, the interesting thing about a paragraph is that we've had the concept for hundreds of years and its entire history has been to <em>visually</em> convey the start of something. Its meaning winds up coming from the visual.  The sentence above <em>looks</em> like a paragraph on the screen or on the printed page, so, in effect it is.  Except that it isn't really.  But we'll get to that.</p>\n\n\t    <p>Some of you may have seen a mark like this before: ¬∂.  If not, that's ok - it's an editor's mark called a \"pilcrow\".  It <em>means</em> \"mark the start of a new paragraph\".  Interestingly enough, the reason that paragraphs were historically indented in print comes from the fact that scribes began the habit of just starting a new line and leaving space to come back and draw the pilcrow later.  Once you had the new line and space, you had an easy visual semantic already - the pilcrow becomes just noise.  Editors (or teachers) will sometimes draw this mark between sentences to convey the same: \"You should start a new paragraph here\".</p>\n\n\t    <p>The thing worth noting in this story is that a pilcow (or newline+indent) were <em>visual markers</em> that implied, logically, that you were not just beginning a paragraph, you were inherently ending the previous one.</p>\n\n\t</section>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n    \t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Flat Earth Markup</contextual-heading>\n    \t<p>Flash forward a few hundred years to when we were just beginning to use computers.  GML borrowed the concept of editors marks like the pilcrow in the 1960s.  Thus, they reasoned about things the same way: No \"closing tag\" was required for many things.  These traditions carried on years later in SGML, and years laters still in HTML.  As you may know, the original vocabulary of HTML was based on a lot of SGML at CERN.  It was built \"on the bones\" with the intent that you could view these documents with a web browser and still pretty much understand it.</p>\n\n    \t<p>Given this history, HTML originally (unsuprisingly) contained only the simplest and most basic concepts from print. It was originally intended to be written with a simple rich text style editor in your browser, in a more or less \"flat\" fashion - visually. Thus, something like this might be an example of a really common \"original\" document back in the day:</p>\n\n    \t<code-format type=\"html\"><pre>&lt;h1&gt;This marks the top level heading\n&lt;p&gt;You can know that this is a paragraph and not heading,\nbecause paragraphs and headings are mutually exclusive ideas,\nso, no need for a closing tag to that h1\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can know that the previous paragraph\nends when this one starts, because anything else would be non-sensical.\nIt is, effectively, a pilcrow, no need to close the p\n&lt;h2&gt;You can know that this is a subsection because we haven't hit\nanother h1 yet.\n&lt;p&gt;And so on..</pre></code-format>\n\n    \t<p>Except... Remember at the beginning when I said that sentence \"wasn't a paragraph?\"  In fact, it is a <code tag-esc=\"\">span</code> <em>inside</em> of the previous paragraph.  That is something that defies logic, and yet - there it is.  Kind of.</p>\n\n    \t <div style=\"margin-top: 0; background-color: transparent;\" class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/always-a-problem.jpg\" alt=\"George Costanza 'Why must there always be a problem?'\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n    \t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Much ado about nothing?</contextual-heading>\n\n\t    \t<p>A lot of people might think <em>who cares? is it that big of a deal?</em>.  Yes, I think it is.  We can't understand an \"outline\" of the document and it would be super if we could.  Have you ever wanted to auto-generate a table of contents?  Well, you can't easily do that based on mud or at best it is a really \"dumb\" outline.  If the only way to really discern the proper boundaries of a section and their relationships with \"headings\" requires eyesight, well, machines don't have it.  What if a new device, like a watch or something came along and wanted to generate an outline and present you with sections?  How could it?  Or how about this: You're driving in your car and I send you a link that says \"read the history section here\".  Wouldn't it be nice if you could ask your phone's voice assistant \"open this link and read me the history section\".  Or wouldn't it be nice if search engines and AI could analyze  your sections?    Oh, and also anyone using assistive technology (AT) would have a hard time.  I mention them last because I want to stress that, <em>in fact, all of these things rely on the same stuff</em>.  It's not just \"people using screen readers\" who need this. You too, effectively use (and will increasingly use) a kind of AT.</p>\n\n    \t</section>\n\n    \t<div style=\"margin-top: 0\" class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/what-did-you-want-to-be.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\tWhat did headings want to be? How did we want an outline to work? I don't remember... but it certainly wasn't this.\n\t\t</div>\n\n    \t<p>Ok, so why are we so bad at this?  First, I think it is because we are by and large such visual creatures.  If the visual semantics \"seem right\" we just kind of assume they are - even when they are total shit.  While \"default visual styling\" was supposed to be a side-effect of getting it right, it seems to have played the opposite role since it is so easy to muck up everything else and still get the visuals right.  You can put a heading in any old place - like as the only child of a meaningless element.  What is that a heading for? When does that \"section\" start and stop?  It's hard to definitively know.  Likewise, search engines making use of headings intelligently was supposed to be a side effect of getting it right too.  Given all this, we seem to have always stressed the side-effects and forgot the meaning.</p>\n\n\n    \t<p>However, it's not just that \"we made a mess by misusing them\" - the truth is, they are kind of unusable.  It's implausible to imagine reasoning about things with flat markers anymore.   Modern documents aren't flat, not remotely.  They are increasingly rich and structured and highly stylized.  Today we have complex sections and articles and navs and things <em>between</em> those and so on.  Hell, modern documents frequently contain a lot of markup that exists purely as something to hang CSS on.   We just cannot reason about \"markers\" in the same way.  We can create one hell of a mess though thinking that it actually \"means\" what it seems to clearly mean visually.</p>\n\n \t\t<div style=\"margin-top: 0\" class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/whatever-you-want-it-to.jpg\n\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\tSome people seem to think \"it means whatever the hell you want it to mean\".  It doesn't.\n\t\t</div>\n\n    \t<p>Consider all of the ways that we stitch together forms of reusable fragments: CMSs, build tools, application servers and templates, etc.  All of those are Really Good Things.  A whole lot of the Web only exists because of them.  Except that there is <em>no way to know ahead of time which level heading is actually appropriate to include in a reusable fragment!</em>  Wow.</p>\n\n    \t<p>Now - here's the really really shitty part: <em>We kind of seem to have known this since the beginning</em>.  Before there was a W3C, before there was a Netscape or even a Mosaic, before almost anyone even knew there was a \"web\" there was already (and continued to be) a lot of talk scratching around the idea that \"flat\" doesn't work here and at least at some level trying to talk about things in terms of just \"sections with headings\".  In fact, the in the 4th email ever sent to the new www-talk mailing list <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee described this as his preference himself</a>.  Note that the first message was Tim testing the server, and the second was announcing itself and 3rd was someone subscribing.  Realistically, one can say this might have been <em>the first real chat</em> about something in HTML.  Let that sink in.</p>\n\n    \t <div class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/serenity-now.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Costanza yelling 'Serenity now!'\">\n\t\t</div>\n\n    </section>\n\n    <section class=\"sectioning\">\n    \t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Round Earth Headings</contextual-heading>\n    \t<p>So yeah - the earth is round, documents are structured, and we should fix this problem with headings.</p>\n\n    \t<p>During the creation of HTML5, this was much discussed and there was a proposal for how to create a \"Document Outline\".  This was speculative fiction, no one implemented it. Not even a little bit.  Not even at all.</p>\n\n    \t<p>In June 2014, Steve Faulkner posted a kind of speculative polyfill (aka prollyfill) for an <code tag-esc=\"\">h</code> element which was implemented in Polymer and tried to stride the line that the Document Outline did.  Then, just recently, Jonathan Neal reopened the discussion with a \"not exactly custom element\" speculative polyfill (it uses Mutation Observers to achieve that effect).  That's great, I'm very excited.  So, Jon and I consulted a bit on this new <code tag-esc=\"\">h</code> proposal.  I felt like I was having a hard time articulating my thoughts, and particularly why I had the same kinds of worries and what I'd like to see (and why).  So I wrote this to explain.  You see, a lot of proposals  so far seem to kind of attempt to stride the flat earth/round earth line. They carry on or adapt, to some degree or other, either the idea that the implication of starts can work or that 'level' is seperable somehow from structure.  However, I think these things are just kind of fundamentally broken and failed at their core.  So here's what I'd like to see, and what I think is missing that will really help... Nothing.</p>\n    \t\n    </section>\n\n    <section style=\"clear:both\" class=\"sectioning\">\n\n    \t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The Seinfeld Pitch</contextual-heading>\n    \t<p>Ok, ready?  What does the <code tag-esc=\"\">h</code> tag mean?  Nothing.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Ok, that probably needs more...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It is possible to create a fairly simple receipe in which you <em>can</em> express meaningful outlines with an <code tag-esc=\"\">h</code> tag.  If you use it this way, we can derive meaning.  If you don't - for example, if an author tries to flat-earth them, or nest them, or do some other crazy shit - we can't.  That's where the Nothing comes in.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image share-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/well_do_nothing.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\tEveryone is doing something.  We'll do nothing.\n\t\t</div>\n\n    \t<p>Let's pretend that you just open an editor and start typing HTML today and you use a <code tag-esc=\"\">foo</code> tag.  You can, you always could  You know what it means?  Nothing.  You know what it looks like?  Again, Nothing.  Its insides match its outsides.  That seems... good?</p>\n\n    \t<p>Now, let's imagine something else: Take your <code tag-esc=\"\">foo</code> and style it to look like an <code tag-esc=\"\">h1</code>.  Visually it means <code tag-esc=\"\">h1</code> - just like our opening example.  But guess what it means to everything else?  Nothing.</p>\n\n    \t<p>I would wager that if anyone suggested that we simply solve the heading problem by adding an <code tag-esc=\"\">h</code> rule to the default UA stylesheet, pretty much everyone would have the same reaction \"you will confuse authors - because it <em>means Nothing</em>\".  And they'd be right - but that's kind of what we've been doing with headings all these years.  In those scenarios where authors wrote funky markup, the visual looks great, but the tree is whack.  It means \"nothing\" (or at least it is misleading enough to not have real meaning). That seems... bad?</p>\n\n    \t<p>I think this is kind of broken. Our \"meaning\" isn't obvious by default visually, so we're lulled into thinking it is \"mostly right\" or something, but really, that's a side effect.</p>\n\n    \t<p>Imagine instead that we wrote that such that only a \"good\" tag would take on any meaning at all - even visually.  The rest would be explictly Nothing.  Then, our insides would match our outsides again.  It would be a really good incentive to learn \"the right way to convey meaning\" and to apply it.</p>\n\n    \t<p>A really incomplete visualization/explanation of this can be seen in <a href=\"http://codepen.io/bkardell/pen/vgbgBp?editors=1100\">this codepen</a> and I've opened <a href=\"https://github.com/jonathantneal/hfill/issues/3\">an issue in Jon's repo</a> to discuss it.</p>\n\n\n    </section>\n\n    <p class=\"thanksTo\">Very special thanks to Jeremy Keith for locating the email I was looking for originally from www-talk but had been unable to find.

Wait, what's that? You've never even heard of this mailing list? No worries, I'll fill you in and tell you why this is important...</p>\n\n\t<p>Chances are pretty good that you've never even heard of the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/\">public-w3process</a> group, but it's dedicated toward discussion of, effectively, process changes at the W3C.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The Process</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Everything about how the W3C works is codified in a document called \"The Process\".  It's a really important document, but a <em>very</em> dull one.  However, if you want to change the way that the W3C actually <em>works</em>, then ultimately, you have to modify it, which must be done in accordance with... surprise: The Process.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Generally speaking, the Terrible, Awful, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Job of maintaining this document is the domain of the Advisory Board (AB).  It takes a long time and it is painful process that involves lots of debate with lots of people about all sorts of arcane silliness.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Traditionally, these changes and discussion about them had happened more or less behind closed doors until this list was started in 2011.  Kudos to the W3C for opening it up.  Now, pretty much anyone in the whole world can follow, read, join or participate in the discussion, etc.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If a process change occurs in the forrest... Well, you might see where I'm going with this: In the ~5 years that it's been open, only 43 brave souls on the entire planet have signed up.  Far fewer have actually participated at all and only a tiny few are involved more than a few times.  You might wonder why that is, because it sounds kind of crazy.  Let me answer by way of analogy:  If someone forced you to choose between following W3C process changes and eating drywall, I'd recommend getting a bib and a whole lot of your favorite condoment. It is that boring and arcane.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Right now there is a conversation happening there which is 50+ replies deep and spans several different email threads.  Most of the posts are about this size of this article and the topic is incubation.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<p><em>Zzzz... ok, wake up, this is where the real important stuff enters.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>As you may or may not know, there is a movement in the W3C to embrace incubation as a part of the process.  I've mentioned aspects of this in blog posts since before there was an thing with a name we could point to, but I don't know that I've ever written about it and explained why I think it is so important on it's own, so here it is....</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Old Fiction: Why we need incubation</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>If you ask \"who writes the specs\" the answer is inevitably \"some standard development organization\".  This often leads to the wrong mental image.  To paraphrase a friend who will remain nameless just incase they regret their particularly colorful choice of words:</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>So many people come to standards work with stars in their eyes and say, \"Well, I just have to get it in the standard and it will be real\" and \"we're doing R&amp;D here\" and... I just want to find ways to kill those people [because] this is really about consolidation and building a platform that we can agree upon and then building value on top of that [and markets in which they can fail].</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>That's a big problem historically with no easy seeming answers deployed so far.  Or, rather, it's <em>several</em> big problems.  Let me explain...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Once you're on a working group you can propose anything and very frequently it is difficult for the average developer to tell the difference between \"Just some shit than Brian wants to do\" and \"Something that has a really good shot at being widely implemented soon\". There's also no formal recognition of some very real realities.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>First, that they operate generally by willing cooperation of interested parties and very few actually fund development of the software or control the codebases required to make these things a reality. We can say \"that sucks\" or \"it shouldn't be that way\" but, we're  lying if we simply continue to pretend that that \"isn't so\".  It is.  Second, each of those organizations that do fund or control a codebase have different interests and priorites.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This mix of things leads to, as you might imagine, a lot of contention in the working groups themselves between all parties.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Worse still was the idea that browsers would ship \"experimental\" support by simply prefixing it.  Developers didn't understand that these were experimental and that their intent was to have <em>some</em> way for people to actually use it and give feedback about how to make it better and then kill it off in favor of the \"real\" thing - so that actually couldn't happen.  Instead, this led to even more contention - accusations that vendors were trying to create a scenario where the only viable option was to use precisely what they'd proposed.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>All of this, as you can probably guess, leads to it taking a very long time to get both concensus and interoperable implementations widely deployed to where the average developer can actually try to use them, because there is some promise of actually getting some work done with it.  That is, after all, the point.  It is also, all too often the case that very frequently initial enthusiasm is quickly dampened as developers come to find that it isn't quite what they were hoping for and a number of things that they wanted aren't there, and that getting that means going back to the drawing board.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This is frequently the stage where a number of people attempt to enter the process, now that we have mostly open mailing lists.  To do so, they have to find which arcane list to join and figure that out.  Once joining they are often met with a number of unfortunate side-effects - the realization that this is noisy and complicated and takes a really long time.\"Super-groups\" like CSS have tons of proposals at various stages and covering a staggering variety of concerns.  It is nearly economically impossible for a developer to be involved in the real formation of a spec.  These incentives mean that an awful lot of conversation that happens in the working groups surrounds trying to \"get it right\" for developers: What will they prefer, what will they understand, what use cases will they have.  Which, of course, everyone has an opinion on.  As you may predict, this makes things take even longer.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If all of this sounds kind of deeply intertwined and seems like it creates a kind of self-magnifying cascade of poo, I agree.  Thus, the desire to change it and the proposal for ways we might do better.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Incubation: Useful speculation</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Put very simply, incubation is based on the idea that until a certain point, things are really just useful speculation and that finding better ways to identify it as such and work within that idea may be very advantageous.  If we're really fortunate, instead of the cascade of bad, we can build a virtuous cycle of good. This is the aim of the Web Incubator Community Group (<a href=\"https://wicg.io\">WICG</a>).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Instead of entering the conversation as a something that looks like more than it is in a working group then, ideas begin in incubation.  Incubation happens out in the open, and not on a mailing list where you have to subscribe to everything but in a forum where you can choose smaller, more focused topics to participate in and engage in those.  They don't just come from working group members either because they are, just that: Ideas.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>No more vendors shipping with a prefix - experiments are experimental, they can't leak out into the open by being confused with more than they are.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This lowers the barrier to entry and focuses the discussion.  Working group members too can benefit from this as it turns out that not even all members are really interested in all things.  Let's just move the noise in to an appropriately noisy place and be clear about what it is until we're reasonably certain that it stands a really good chance of becomming more.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Incubation goes hand in hand with the <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">Extensible Web Manifesto</a>.  For a lot of things, we can build <em>prollyfills</em>.  If you're unfamilliar with that term, there are some new efforts to re-brand those \"speculative polyfills\" - that is, something experimental which is intended to give you a very good idea what working with that standard will be like, but actually works today in all browers.  The idea here is to short-circut the conversation allowing developers to weigh in themselves at a far earlier stage and with a better value proposition.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>How much earlier?  Well, the \"real lifetime\" of a lot of ideas that have made it to \"widely deployed standard\" status is a decade or more.  People were talking about what would become flexbox, for example, in at least 2004 (very possibly earlier).  <em>Most</em> of the things in Selectors Level 4 (and some still not in 4) were already in a draft in 1998.  But you couldn't <em>use</em> any of them.  This meant that taking the time to follow the conversations and understand them and comment on them along the way was impractical - very impractical.  It was intimidating too for anyone who wanted to discuss, and frustrating because chances are very good that there were long conversations and topics years ago that you really should have a look at before commenting, but how would you even know that.  The mailing lists make this hard.</p>\n\t\t<p>By comparison, I have seen people turn around a functional approximation in incubation upon request in just a day or two.  Not all of them, of course, but it is frequently faster, the number of people who can contribute is much greater, and it is clearly nothing more than \"potentially useful speculation\" on a particular/limited topic.  Generally speaking, topics are much easier to deal with as topics than a collection of searchable emails.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Fears</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Change is difficult and make no mistake, including incubation as an even relatively formal concept in W3C is a change.  It's natural then that some people have fears. Working groups have been the exclusive way to work for a really long time. Why should something not happen in a working group if members of the working group think it should start there and most mailiing lists, like www-style, are technically forums open to the public?  How doesn't this hollow out working groups and make them nothing more than paper-pushers as things move through the process?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The interesting thing is, it's actually a smaller change in practice than you might think.  Currently, the vast majority of specs have a single primary editor and sometimes two or three collaborators.  They work outside of any working group and answer most of the questions, and have deep discussion and come back with an answer.  It's only at this point that the rest of the working group often talks about it much at all.  There are also exceptionally noisy conversations along the way between other folks on IRC or slack or lots of other venues to help them hammer out ideas which they then bring back to wider audiences.  They move the noise, because that's just how information works.  In many cases then, what incubation provides is, realistically, mostly a move of the venue and the admission of how serious/likely it is to become a standard.</p>\n\t\t<p>Working Groups and Incubation are not mutually exclusive ideas, they are complimentary ideas. The aim of incubation is not to replace working groups, as much as to simply to help setup healthier scenarios that provide checks and balances earlier on and allow ideas to succeed or to improve or fork in ways that working groups currently make confusing and difficult.  It's to help balance out the idea of 'powers' and recognize realities.  It's even to just let ideas fail and move on.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Is it the only way to achieve these goals?  Probably not, and it's not fully fleshed out or perfect - but I think it's the best start on an answer that we have so far.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Cool Story Bro</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>So why do you care, and what am I asking of you?  Well, it's my opinion that this is your Web, as much as it is any W3C member orgs Web.  Ultimately, it is developers who have to live with this stuff.  It's developers who advocate and adopt and occasionally complain about or even occasionally outright reject standards.  You are, in the end, a very important piece of the puzzle and I don't know that anyone is really specifically asking you what you think.  I don't think that you should have to wade through all of the discussions but, somehow, you should be heard.  Your voice matters, if you want it to.  But noone <em>else</em> is gonna do it, if we want to be involved, we've got to be involved.  I think that incubation is an important part of that, but I'm just one guy.  So I'm asking you to start a public discussion, share your perspective - tweet, blog, share. Or, if you're uninterested with changing anything, feel free to ignore.  Here's my own perspective:</p>\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/incubate_the_things.jpg?a=1\" alt=\"Incubate All the Things\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t</section>\n\n",

I didn't have to set anything up, I use it, people all over the world read it - and did I mention it was free?  What else is there really?  But I've always wanted more control, and ownership of your own content is a really good thing, so couple of weeks ago, I broke down and bought <a href=\"https://bkardell.com\">bkardell.com</a>. Given a domain, I decided that now that moving lots of legacy content there would be an interesting and fun exercise. I'd like to tell you about some things it's made me think about...</p>\n\n\t<p>Being a nerd with a new green field pet project with no deadline is fun, so when I decided to move my legacy posts to my new domain I decided not to just install some blogging software.  I'll take it slow, build it out from nothing - try to have no preconceived notions and re-experience pain (or not).  So, every morning for the past week, instead of reading twitter I while I drank my coffee, I worked on my site for half an hour.  I made some HTML and CSS and setup a home page.  Then I added a build so that I can generate pages from templates and a few other things.  Then, for most of the week, each morning I opened the wordpress editor and copied a post into my new little system, made a few tweaks, and moved on. For now, I'd just leave the image hosting to wordpress until I got the all content up, then maybe I'll write a little tool to download them all and update their URLs automatically.  That was the plan.  Fun.  Each day, I'd pat myself on the back and think \"Well done Brian, well done.\"</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">And then I saw it</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Friday morning, after I had already closed the Wordpress editor containing the post that I was moving, I realized that I'd messed up a URL for an image during editing.  Instead of re-opening the editor, I just went to the post and opened devtools to grab it. Then I noticed it: <em>My simple blog post on wordpress.com had been making over a hundred HTTP requests and weighing in at 4.3Mb!</em> </p>\n\n\t\t<p>Wait.... What?  How???  I recoiled in horror.  How had they not taken away my nerd license??  My immediate reaction was to do some more analysis - just in order to properly deepen my feelings of shame.  I setup devtools to emulate 3g and a low end device and pulled the blog post up again.  It took almost 16 seconds to reach DOMContentLoaded and 48 seconds to reach Loaded. In reality, about 20 seconds before I had usefully readable content.  I fed it to <a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org\">https://www.webpagetest.org</a> - it choked before giving me a report, twice. (There were a lot of accessibility issues too, but that's another post)</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Clearly, this was terrible.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">A timeout for nuance</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>Apologies for this long caveat, but I feel like it is necessary in our industry... Look, everything has nuance. Lest someone take the observations this post out of context, and go start beating one another over the head, I want to ask:  Is this really a catastrophic problem?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>It feels bad to a developer to see this, for sure.  But it seems that it was not, in fact, a problem of epic proportions.  Many people, from all around the world read my blog. Not a single person ever commented on this.  Further, I frequently proof my own posts and even go back and find them when I'm in some distant location trying to remember something - and in all the years that I had it, I have never once noticed it to be a problem.  \"Yes, but..\" you think \"you are tech guy in a wealthy country with unlimited speed - you wouldn't notice it\".  Except that in this case that's not entirely true.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>You see, I recently spent 2 years living with a very low-end Android phone that you can buy (not with a plan, brand new) for $20 retail.  I live in and regularly visit areas with some pretty terrible sketchy/slow mobile service. Why?  Because I am a real person.  Real people run the gambit of situations and mine briefly made this a choice I was willing to live with for a time.  Even under these conditions, I never noticed.  You might wonder how that is possible, so I'll explain...</p>\n\n\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">Real People, Real Cases</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t<p>How fast should your site load? How many bytes should it be? I believe the answer is not a number any more definititely quantifiable than the question \"what kind of car should I buy?\".  The answer is frequently circumstantial - it depends on what you need to do with it, how much you have to invest, the climate that you live in and so on.  This is no different.  Everything you view in a Web browser is not equal simply because it is in a Web browser, it's a negotiation of a lot of complex factors in real life for both you and your users.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>When I'm on 3g, I know things are going to take longer.  When I'm on shitty hardware, I know my hardware is shitty. In these conditions, I won't leave your site in 2 seconds if it doesn't load.  Why?  Because nothing loads in 2 seconds in those conditions.  Literally nothing.  Opening twitter on that device could take, in some cases, 10 seconds.  I'm willing to wait, in fact, I don't even notice the wait time after a while because I know that it is my situation.  It was my norm.  Further, in this  case (the native Twitter app), I know that I am paying a startup cost and that once it's all loaded and primed it'll be absolutely fine.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>I develop lots of apps that have all sorts of different concerns.  Sometimes they are on an internal network where we control the browsers and once logged in people are in it pretty much all day every day.  In those kinds of cases, I don't worry about these sorts of things so much.  Loading 2 or 3Mb isn't a huge concern in those cases, especially if you can heavily cache and reduce those payments to be very infrequent things.  Spending an inordinate amount of time and money catering to an audience we don't have would be wasteful.  Sure, we might save our company users a fraction of a second once a day, maybe even a whole second.  But... They're not going anywhere.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>The time that influences the bounce rate for online banking is probably much much higher than it is for an article that you only kinda sorta wanted to read in the first place, and everything else lives on a scale somewhere in between.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>So, please - read this all with nuance.  I am not making a hard-line argument that everything needs to be infinitely tweaked. How lean is lean enough? How fast is fast enough? It's debatable... Obviously, lighter and faster is always better, but there is a point of diminishing return that you'll have to decide for yourself.</p>\n\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">For <em>me</em>, this is unacceptable</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>All those caveats aside, this is still unacceptable to me and here's why:  As I said, articles are not special in any way.  I'm not going to get a lot of good will because a user really wants to or needs to read my post.  I'm not providing a service.  Users don't want to \"spend time\" with my blog.  We're not building relationships there or achieving tasks to our complete work.  For a number of people, it might be the only time they ever visit my site.  They're not playing a game or conferencing.  Maybe they just <em>kind of</em> want to read some fucking content. In my experience, this is precisely the kind of thing that I would give up on if it took too long.  Further, I really really <em>want</em> them to read my content.  For me, I have another concern:  Metered connections.  I have a whole lot of readers who travel internationally and have metered plans while traveling.  It's awfully nice if they read my post, but it feels a little thoughtless if I take a noticable hunk of their plan if I can avoid it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">So now what?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Well, at least now I was in control and - I know that <em>I</em> did not require 100 HTTP requests, so I opened my new post to compare:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><em>Number of requests</em>: 13.  Yes, much much better. <em>DOMContentLoaded</em> in milliseconds, not seconds.  Much better.  <em>Size?</em>  Still megabytes large.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><em>Let me put this into perspective:  The HTML, CSS and even my avatar all combined weigh in at a whopping 20k.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>So where were all these megabytes coming from?  JavaScript?  Nope, I didn't have any yet. None. The answer is images.  Another post was even worse - 21mb and mostly because of a single animated gif.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"5\" style=\"font-size: 3rem;\">Enter: suprisingly interesting problem</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>This raises an interesting challenge that I don't frequently get to spend a lot of time thinking about... The traditional CMS and \"page oriented\" web and content with graphics.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"6\" style=\"font-size: 3.25rem;\">The scary thing</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>On some level, the truly scary thing is how it got that way:  After all, I'm not the average Joe who you give a CMS to in order to create content.  I am savvy.  I do this for a living.  But CMS's have been around for a long, long time and there are lots of products and when it comes to a problem that is easily handled with a CMS, my attitude is often just \"well, let's just use a CMS for that, there are more interesting problems to solve\".  It's unlike me to just assume things, but I assumed that Wordpress.com was really doing a lot more for me than it was.  The brand, the interface, and the ease with which I could setup and publish content made me essentially 'forget' to really care about any of this stuff.  My first thought was that if I am writing huge pages as someone with skills, I wonder what happens to people who walk into this without any knowledge?  I'll bet there are some truly gnarly blog pages out there.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The good news is that simply optimizing even <em>some of</em> my images, turning some animated gifs into video and choosing better image formats for some things and the image weight went from megabytes to a few hundreds of kilobytes.  But, is that good enough?  Maybe.  At least it isn't blatantly disrespectful of their plans and bandwidth, but it led me to an interesting bit of thought...</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I frequently write my blog posts with themes and images for no \"real\" reason other than that I happen to like that.  I spent some time finding an acceptable way to make the same images look good, size and layout well on any device.  It's my style.  I find it more engaging. I think that my readers usually do too.  I don't have data to back that up beyond that I continue to have readers and that often people comment in relation to that aspect as much as the content itself.  I'd really prefer not to change that.  It's my style.  So I'm left with an interesting choice:  Stop being me, or conceed that I'm unwilling to give you content without the images... Just serve the less engaging content to everyone.  Am I?  Sometimes perhaps?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"6\" style=\"font-size: 3.25rem;\">Optional Images and a budget</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Here's why this is an interesting problem to me:  Images aren't new, we've had them since 1996 and this has kind of always been the case, but the truth is that our approach doesn't take a lot into account.  Whether I am willing to give you content without images or content with images or content with fewer images has a lot to do with the role of the image.  Sometimes, images are really important.  As an amature painter, I can tell you that I have posts in which the image <em>is</em> the primary content. I have other cases where there's an important illustration and then I have a bunch of stuff that is less so. It's more than just visual decoration, but less than absolutely critical.  Thus far, I haven't seen any realy interesting ways of dealing with this as a <em>set of problems</em>...</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Every 6 months or so, someone floats an idea about being able to make media queries based on connection speed or whether your connection is metered or not, but these are always problematic and quickly shot down.  The browser just really has no excellent way of knowing - bandwidth fluctuates, there are privacy concerns, people tether and use all kinds of weird setups. Further, I'm not sure it should be <em>only</em> my decision.  As I said earlier, what you're willing to read or wait for is a negotiation of sorts - but how can we negotiate this?</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This has me thinking it might be worth running some experiments with UI.  I'm beginning to mark my images as essential or optional, I'm collecting the weight of optional images and setting up some rules around it in my build such that when I have scenarios that might be costly but are mostly due to my writing flare, I can ask you whether that's ok and give you the option of skipping them and saving that choice on that device so that I don't annoy you if you're never in that situation (or always are).  This approach should really limit the amount of time I spend pestering 99% of users to somewhere between 0 (if they never encounter a themed post with a size beyond my totally arbitrary limit of 200k for my own assets) and 1 (the first time they hit one).  Will this cause a big bounce rate increase and actually be counter productive?  I honestly don't know...

Very recently a <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.m50p34qi8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">satirical piece on this subject</a> really struck a chord and got a lot of attention. Dion Almaer <a href=\"https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/i-want-to-go-back-to-the-1950s-of-web-development-fa69d7fe357a#.bqj5a5ug1\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a piece in reply </a>in which he introduced what I thought was a really good analogy - the rose colored glasses that we often see the past through...</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>...it reminds me of folk who talk about the golden era of the 1950s in the US. It isn't hard to look at the current political climate and long for another time. Remember the white picket fences? Life was so good! Those glasses sure are rosy though, and when you take them off you see a society that had huge problems...</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>\"Huge Problems\" is an understatement at the level of \"the surface of the sun is warm\". In many ways, if most of us were placed in 1950's America we would characterize it as xenophobic, sexist and racist - but also not exactly afraid of taxes or the idea that the government had a big role to play. Today we squabble like it is an all-life-on-earth-ending decision to make what are historically very minor tax tweaks - we just know that the past was somehow better... They were the \"glory days\" and we don't seem to give a lot of thought to why.</p>\n\n\t<p>We seem to do this with everything - it's kind of human nature I think. Ask a 50 year old about their teenage years and they'll likely regale you with stories that make it seem pretty good. Now ask a teen how they feel you'll likely get a very different perspective. Things seem to get simplified, polished and a little more rosy with time. Somewhere in between these is probably a fairly objective 'reality'.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The Web's Glory Days that I don't actually recall...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Like Dion, I feel like we're doing that a little with our perspective of writing for the Web. If what you remember (or the story that you've heard) is that \"once upon a time we just wrote HTML (and maybe CSS) - there weren't so many frameworks and programming to learn and life was good\"- then we have very different recollections.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If you were writing only HTML and CSS before, for example, and you're not anymore then you're comparing apples and oranges. If you could before, you still can. However, in reality, most sites were not that, even \"static\" ones.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Did you manually copy, paste, edit things like your header and footer? If you did, you were one of a small few because these were problems that were obvious even in the mid-90s and answers were provided by even the earliest servers and many popular \"IDEs\" of the time or tools made it possible to do this as a 'build time' process.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Also obvious, even in the mid-90's, was that no-one would sit and write HTML all day, every day. HTML was, by design, intended to be the lingua-franca for common understanding. It was the thinking that most of it perhaps would be generated by a program, not authored by hand. In fact, the very first significant use, even at CERN, involved writing programs that wrote HTML and TimBL's original browser effectively hid the HTML from you.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>To generate HTML from bits, to query a database or services and so on, to hide things under non-standard abstractions - you need a programming language. Enter the complexity and the variance.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Over the years I have watched as people built sites using tons of server-side and build tech in order to do precisely this. These involved choosing a server. Once you have a server, frequently there are N choices of languages you can use. Given a language there are frequently N templating languages and N possible frameworks you can use to express how those things pinned together. Some of them required compilation, many had a concept of 'build time' work. All of them also had to deal with server configuration that dealt with how you deal with things like threading, connection pooling, caching, etc. All of them dealt with databases, and so on. Did you use cgi/bin and Perl? Did you use .asp and COM? Did you use Java? If you did, did you use JSPs, FreeMarker, ECS, Velocity, JSF or Ice Faces? Did you use Struts, Spring MVC, Spark, Dropwizard? Did you transpile with something like GWT? Did you ever try thinking about portlets? Or did you prefer Ruby on Rails? Or PHP? If it sounds like I am reaching for examples, I can assure you this is an exceptionally abbreviated list of actually popular approaches that I have encountered. People who dealt with those all had similar complaints to the ones I hear now.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Building this stuff - especially building it well, has never, to the best of my knowledge, or in my experience, been simple.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's never not involved a lot of variety of choice or strong opinions about \"the right way\" or what is \"good enough\" or tough/interesting challenges regarding how to fit into existing ecosystems. Instead, primarily what seems to have changed is where it's possible to build what.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Today it is possible to build rich, engaging UI that happens on the client that wasn't really possible before JavaScript - but it's also not exactly new - merely the level at which we aspire to do it is. By the mid-2000's sites were getting pretty rich. The reason we have HTML5 is that JavaScript allowed us to not stand still and wait for something better to come along.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Was this the simpler time? Not for me it wasn't - in addition to all of the server frameworks, every week there was a new library. Prototype, Scriptaculous, MooTools, Dojo, qooxdoo, Bindows, YUI, ext.js and many more, until finally jQuery. But jQuery itself was pretty low level and stopped there as opposed to something like ext.js which came complete with a UI toolkit. This is where a lot of frameworks come in today - it's not necessary maybe to have a 'client approach' and a 'server approach' be quite so far apart - maybe that's good.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">An added bit of non-technical complexity</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Somewhere along the way, we seem to have had a split. In some orgs that I worked for, this was all considered \"equal\". I was a \"full stack\" developer and the whole stack was equally important. In other orgs, there were \"front-end\" developers and the front-end was an important discipline on it's own, but it was separate from \"design\". Design was more of a static deliverable of HTML and CSS and maybe some \"demo-y\" JavaScript that we probably wouldn't really use. Some people saw that as lesser, some people just thought of it as different. In still others all of this was somehow viewed as \"lesser\" and \"not real programming\" and so many \"real programmers\" avoided it and handed it to people who were actually primarily interested in designs and didn't have experience with \"real programming languages\". In the meantime, a lot of people strode weird middle grounds.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><strong>So... suck it up?</strong></p>\n\n\t\t<p>No, none of this is to say \"suck it up folks, that's just how it is\". I too feel like it's gotten a little overwhelming. But I'm more overwhelmed by simpler things. It was a really nice quality of jQuery, for example, that you can simply grab a release off a CDN, include it however you like, and go. Frequently, a simple <code tag-esc=\"\">script</code> include was \"good enough\" and you were off to the races. Today, a lot of projects lack that level of friendliness. You need to have node installed. And NPM. And probably a certain build tool. And maybe something like TypeScript - just in order to get a single file. And it might be that that file really wants to work with a package manager that you don't know about so you have to get that - and so on. It's hard to not feel overwhelmed by that alone. We should really work on that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But I'm also fairly realistic about what we can/should do about it I guess and why I think it is that way. History shows that eventually we do shake the good bits out into standards - and it's slow, kind of painful and more than a little overwhelming at times along the way. But I find hope in knowing that we're all working on making that process a lot better by reconsidering how we approach standards (see also <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a>, The <a href=\"https://wicg.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">W3C Incubator CG</a> and <a href=\"https://chapters.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Chapters</a>). If we can make this lifecycle better, that could be pretty dramatic. The best thing about standardizing things on the client, in my opinion, is that there's only one. JavaScript isn't really in competition with 17 other languages and there is ultimate only the DOM. That's at least something promising.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But let's also try to remain realistic in how we compare the present to the Glory Days.</p>\n\t</section>\n",

For the past week I've watched as all sorts of arguments have been made by friends of mine on both sides and wanted to weigh in and share some thoughts, but my life hasn't been cooperating. Finally, I have a moment so I tried to put down some thoughts that have been banging around in my head... No guarantee they are coherent and I'm out of time, so here they are....</p>\n\n\n\t<p>A lot of developers (by far the vast majority) don't work for browser vendors, they aren't involved in building frameworks or standards development. They don't have the time to spend a few years considering all of the gory little details and discussions that got us to where we are today.  A lot of us stay in the loop by looking to and take queues from a comparatively small number of people who do and boil it down for us. We all have to do this with at least some things.  Then, we then further categorize into \"good\" and \"bad\" piles mentally, and we use that to determine what's worth spending time on or what will be a waste. Right now, for most people, it's probably a little overwhelming. Which pile do Web Components belong in? Are they going to be Shangri La or a real shit show?</p>\n\n\t<p>The answer is: No. Neither. A little of both at times. I'm sorry if that sounds wishy-washy but real life is like that.  It's full of grays. We move forward in fits and starts.  We frequently can't even predict what people will do with things until they get them - I've written about all of this a lot.  Reality is messy.  Getting agreement is hard.  Truth is often subtler than we imagine and non-binary.</p>\n\n\t<p>Let me explain what I mean though because without more, that's kind of a non-answer...</p>\n\n\t<p>Web Components are <em>super </em>cool, and also - believe it or not - imperfect. I think that they're a fundamental step toward us getting much better at a lot of things, <em>and</em> I think we're kidding ourselves if we think it's not going to be bumpy for a while while we sort some things out.  I believe that we <em>can</em> make them work with very popular frameworks <em>and I also believe </em>that they are not ideally suited to them today for a number of reasons and that people may choose not to use them.  This creates challenges that I think we are not articulating well and... that actually might matter.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Web Components or Custom Elements?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Since I'm talking about articulating to developers... We're not always clear on this.   Sometimes we're even conflating Web Components with Polymer. We're doing better than we were in 2013, but we've got to do better still.  Polymer isn't Web Components in the way that birds aren't ducks.  Polymer is conceptually built around Web Components, but it's a library.  Because it is a library created by Google and it includes polyfills and prollyfills and because these are not always historically clearly labeled, that's gotten a little confusing sometimes.  Occasionally, that's caused bad feelings.  Use Polymer, React, Angular or Ember.  They're all good, I'm not trying to pick on one.  Just be aware what's what and what isn't.  Your mileage may vary.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So, in an effort to be clear - in this piece I when I say \"Web Components\" I am talking about Custom Elements and Shadow DOM as those are the two pieces that are near shipping.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Can/should you use the current incarnation of Web Components with all of the popular frameworks?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Yes, probably you <em>can</em>... Sort of.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Believe it or not,<em> I think this is where most of the trouble lie</em>s.  \"Can you\" isn't the question to ask.  \"Should you\" or \"Will People\" are the questions.  One group says \"resoundingly yes you should because it is native and therefore is most widely usable.\"  Another counters \"potentially you can, but you really might not want to with a framework because it won't be as convenient as you might think.  A lot of components will either not work or will require wrappers/adapters in practice\".  \"Can\" has a definite answer and, I'm pretty sure the answer is \"yes\" because we can make just about anything work if we try hard enough (see: the entire Web).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That's where \"should you\" comes in and I'm afraid that the answer there doesn't seem so cut and dry - and that \"Will People\" is kind of up in the air.  Why?  Because \"can you\" isn't the only variable.  You've probably had experiences where it gets pretty hard and you think \"is this really worth it?\"  I'll tell you about one of those I had below that makes me sensitive to this one.  I'm happy to be shown \"it's worth it\" in actual practice and \"people will (more than once)\" in the real world, but my own experiences thusfar don't entirely bear that out.  I'll also explain why I'm ok with that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's a pickle. But it's a pickle like \"should you do x\" and we have a lot of those.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Will people use Web Components with their framework?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Yes, or at least they will <em>try </em>if a whole bunch of people are all telling them that for sure this  should work and that's part of what people are worried about.  I'm not sure this is being well articulated but the worry that some have is: It's not going to be the walk in the park that they imagine and that's that's going to turn people off to Web Components. Even framework people think that would be a shame because we <em>all</em> agree that Web Components are a great idea that we absolutely want. Web developers have been disappointed and frustrated a few times already with challenges in the morphing of Web Components as we struggled to get consensus. Regardless of reasons or blame, that seems true and we probably can't afford a lot more of that.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So, should we go back to the drawing board and re-think Web Components from the ground up?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p><em>Hellz No!</em> But, believe it or not, I don't actually think anyone really meant to imply this literally regardless of what they might have said in 140 characters one day after lunch.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Why not?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Because they're a good step forward and not shipping something fits just as neatly under the \"we probably can't afford a lot more of that\" heading.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>For those who might not be aware, \"Web Components\" is actually a cold reboot of many previously failed attempts to do many of the same things - HTC, XUL, XAML, FLEX and XBL were all trying to do the same. These efforts were restarted, to the best of my recollection around 2009 or 2010 under the banner \"Web Components\" - but you can track the general idea of \"custom elements\" (lowercase because they were more like \"Web Components\") in some fashion back, practically as far as the Web itself. In all that time, we have never been so close. Why? Because the problem is hard.  Because new things come along and give us pause. Because consensus is hard. Even just between those who actually make a browser it is, in a word: <em>fucking hard</em>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHnTocdD7sk\" target=\"_blank\">Standards are like this Weird Al Song</a> . On anything that asks for the ability for authors to be able to mint elements and define them, doubly so.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's not the end of the game but we can't move on further until we beat this level.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">So what <em>should</em> we do?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Just be realistic I think. We move forward in steps. If we are pitching an all-singing, all-dancing, no challenges to be found future, that's probably not realistic.  A de-facto <em>implementation</em> that will be used everywhere regardless of framework, might be over-selling a vision until we actually see it broadly happen.  Sure, it might be <em>possible</em>, but possible isn't the only variable.  It's also entirely likely that even if someone posted such a thing, even one with an adapter for Ember or React, or even Polymer of a very popular custom element with \"Web Components Underneath\" that within a few days someone will say \"yeah, but that's inefficient\".  It's pretty easy for them to make a derivative component in their framework that does the same thing but cheaper, and it's very likely that many people with that framework will gravitate toward the \"more efficient for their framework version.\"  I'm not sure.  We'll see.  That's all I'm saying.  That and...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Meh.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Meh?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Yeah, meh. I'm ok with that for now.  We're not there yet, but we'll figure it out as long as we work together.  I know that might sound a little disappointing if you were hoping for total Nirvana - but it's hella better than what we had a few years back.  Declarative solutions are very easy to use and thank goodness we all agree on that much, even to the basic point of how we express them. In fact, all of the major frameworks have a solution that looks a lot like Custom Elements. Here's some markup, is it an Ember component or a Custom Element?  You can't tell.</p>\n\n\t\t<code-format type=\"html\">\n\t\t\t<pre>&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;common-button id=\"btn\"&gt;Status&lt;/common-button&gt;\n  &lt;common-badge icon=\"favorite\" for=\"btn\" label=\"favorite icon\"&gt;&lt;/common-badge&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n\t\t</code-format>\n\n\t\t<p>Yes, it means there might be N implementations of the same thing instead of the one true implementation -- and yes that kinda sucks.  But... meh.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>We have armies of developers who are probably willing to port a popular custom element to their framework of choice until we sort this out.  Within my own company we have some things implemented twice - once as a Custom Element and once as an Angular directive.  It didn't start that way, it<em> wound up that way</em> because that turned out to be easier and more efficient to say to Angular \"Ok - you be you\".  I fought it until I could fight no more.  Now that we did it, it's not the end of the world.  The folks who write markup still don't need to learn something new moving from frameworkless pages to Angular pages.  Their knowledge is portable.  That's not as amazing as I'd originally hoped, but in practice, it's actually been pretty damned good.  And I'll take it over all of the N-solution, very complex alternatives we had before any day.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I believe we will get to the day when that isn't necessary, but - if someone says \"that day might not be today\" I don't think they're just being difficult.  I'm super happy to be shown - in reality - that this isn't likely, but there only time will tell.  Dueling speculations won't tell us, only real experience will.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The mere fact that we can mint tags and easily transfer understanding between all of these is, in itself, a pretty significant leap in my opinion.  That it allows us to begin the process of developers helping to establish the \"slang\" and further wrestles away creative powers from being the sole domain of browser vendors and for standards to play the role of dictionary editors is, in and of itself,<a href=\"https://briankardell.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/dropping-the-f-bomb/\"> pretty significant</a>.  We should throw this in the win column regardless of any of that other stuff.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">What next?  Are we resigned to this forever?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Nah, I don't think so.  We should manage expectations for now, but React, Ember and Angular all have some really interesting observations about declarative serialization and how we express things and why that's a challenge for Web Components within their frameworks.  We should listen.  We should gain some experience.  We should also write the hell out of some Web Components and see what we can do.  Given new abilities I can't wait to see what developers come up with.  New capabilities inevitably breed new ideas and solutions that it's nearly impossible to imagine until it happens.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Will it be as pretty as it might be if we started over?  Probably not, but, I think it'll actually get done this way.  If we make some progress, we inch the impossible destination ever closer.</p>\n\t</section>\n",

So, when I heard that there was going to be a \"standards organization\" setup to bring together all sorts of powerful tech interests and that it would be led by Tim Berners-Lee (creator of the Web) himself, it didn't take much more to win my confidence.</p>\n\n\t<p>I suppose I imagined something between Michelangelo's Creation panel on the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and Raphael's School of Athens. Somewhere, perhaps high in a tower in a proverbial Mount Olympus where the Gods of programming - wise and benevolent beings would debate and design - and the outcome would be an elegant, simple and beautiful solution. They would show us the One True Way. Specifications might have been handed down on tablets of stone as far as I imagined.  The future was bright. They would lead me to the promised land.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/school-of-athens.jpg\" alt=\"A painting of Raphael's School of Athens\">My imagination of what a W3C meeting was like..\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>By around 2009, I guess you could say that my outlook had \"matured\".</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t<video data-src=\"/media/colbert-freaking\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\"></video>\n\t\tMe, circa 2009 expressing my feelings on Web standards.\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>I was jaded, yes.</p>\n\n\t<p>What had happened?  I decided to begin to try following standards a little more \"from the inside\" and I learned a lot.  I talk more about it in the video, but here is the most important takeaway I can give you: <em> There is no standard for standards.</em></p>\n\n\t<p>That is:  We really don't know what we're doing.  Standards are a really \"young\" idea.  In the roughly 100 years we've been trying to deal with them you can sum up a brief history something like this:</p>\n\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Countries established national standards organizations - here in the US, ANSI.</li>\n\t\t<li>National Standards really weren't good enough for some things, so we got an international standards organization: ISO.</li>\n\t\t<li>ISO tweaked how they approached things a few times along the way, but when it came to networks and software, they were kind of abysmal.  After a decade of working on the OSI 7 Layer Model, Vint Cerf and some others left and created the IETF.  We got the internet. The IETF works very differently from ISO/ANSI.</li>\n\t\t<li>When Tim Berners-Lee came along he could have taken things to ISO, or the IETF - and in fact, he did choose the later.  Some things were standardized there, others languished and never actually reached what you could call, in IETF terms, a standard.  After some mulling, the W3C was created.  It works differently than ANSI, ISO or the IETF.</li>\n\t\t<li>When Internet Explorer began reverse engineering JavaScript and Netscape wanted to standardize it, they could have taken it to any of the above.  Instead, they took it to ECMA - a body previously dedicated to the manufacturing standards for computers in Europe.  Why?  Because historical events led them to believe that Microsoft would wield less powerful influence in this venue and that ECMA would be more fair to the creators.  It works differently than all of the above.</li>\n\t\t<li>After a period in which much of the world (including major players like Microsoft who controlled 95% of the browser market share at the time) decided that perhaps HTML wasn't the future we wanted after all and spent a decade trying to influence a different possible future in the W3C, a group defected and created the WHATWG which - again - works very differently than all of the above.  The WHATWG was spun up in 2004, the first draft of HTML was published in 2008.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<p>Along the way we've seen features that were disappointing (AppCache) things that aren't quite interoperable (IndexedDB/WebSQL), things that failed to materialize (native dialogs, the document outline) and battles over control of the \"really official standard\" as well as what that even means.  In late 2014, it reached W3C status that we might call 'standard' - however, there's still a lot that doesn't work in all browsers - HTML input types support, for example.  So it would be foolish to say that process really \"worked well\" in total either.</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-right optional\">\n\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/frabz-tis-blasphemy-cc135d.jpg?w=291\" alt=\"A grizzled man meme pointing and saying 'tis blasphemy!\" width=\"291\" height=\"300\"> It's not blasphemous to suggest that we can do better.\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>The interesting point here is that the reason there are many venues is simple: That the ones that came before them weren't working well and that each of these has tried to adapt to get better.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Lessons Learned</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>In a nutshell: We've moved around a lot of variables a lot of times, trying to figure this out - but the one thing we haven't figured out how to tap into is developers.  This is strange because ultimately, it is developers who decide the fate of it all.  Over the years standards have come to say \"we have businesses, we have academia, we have government.\"</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/a967331492c30ea8002d09b1ebed6bbf.jpg\" alt=\"A captioned scene from The Avengers where Tony Stark says 'We have a Hulk'\"> Bring your army, we have developers.\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>Yay.  That's great.  But, the truth is: we have <em>developers</em>.  Developers are like the Hulk,<em> their potential power is nearly limitless, it's just untapped!  </em>If you want to win the day - you<em> need the Hulk on your side.</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>Think about it.  Microsoft quite literally \"owned\" the browser market and disbanded the team.  When work continued on HTML, it created what might have been an impossible impasse.  There was no obvious way to get there from here.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What happened?  Polyfills. Remy Sharp coined the term and developers stepped up and filled the gap, providing a way forward.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>When virtually every major tech company on earth was focused on \"how on earth can we imagine a new, better 'Web' based on XML?\" - when billions of dollars in R&amp;D had been spent over a decade and everyone was desperately trying to figure it out, developers said \"JSON: I choose you!\".

The problem, at its core, is how we approach/view standards and how we set up the right economics.</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Fixing the economics</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/ewm-1.jpg\" alt=\"The extensible web logo\"> The Extensible Web Manifesto Logo by the great Bruce Lawson\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<p>Around 2010, a lot of people began talking about what was wrong with Web Standards and how we might fix it. This led to, not a new standards body, but a joint statement of core principles by people involved at many levels: <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Since it was published in 2013 it has become a statement of \"core principles\" for all of the major standards bodies involved with the Web.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The Extensible Web Manifesto is a short document, but it comes from considerably more detailed discussions and a bigger vision. It's a vision that says that the economics are broken.  Failure isn't avoidable, it's inevitable.  Experiments are necessary in order to get there from here.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-right optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/capturew5.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of an early fan with a lightbulb socket connecting cord\" width=\"232\" height=\"387\">Early electrical appliances plugged into light sockets!\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>As my friend Matt Griffin explains well both in his A List Apart Article <em><a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/the-future-of-the-web\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of the Web</a></em> and his documentary on the Web <em><a href=\"http://www.futureisnext.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Future is Next</a> </em>- you can't do it right until you've done it wrong.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>History, both of the Web and physical standards proves out that an evolutionary result is inevitable.  When homes were first electrified, for example, it was for the purpose of artificial light.  There weren't outlets - there was nothing to plug in.  Companies were battling over lights.  The result?  Early appliance inventors stepped up and filled the gap - they made cords that screwed into light sockets and birthed a whole new industry!</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The Extensible Web Manifesto simply argues that while we're busy arguing about light bulbs, <em>the really amazing stuff is what you can do given electricity</em> - and that we'll very likely miss it.  It's unanticipatable.  We will try, and we will fail.  All failures aren't dead ends though.  Service Workers, for example, are the result of many failed experiments.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Some failure persists and only <em>looks</em> like failure for a time - the sum of the DNA however ultimately provide new possibilities far far beyond any of our plans.  If you were busy trying to \"design\" the perfect canine you'd never come up with a maned wolf.  Chances are you've never seen a maned wolf since they only evolved in a certain environment in South America.  But they are <em>amazing</em> and kind of a testiment to the power of evolution to create something that survives.  Ultimately, we need things that survive in all of the environments, even the ones we aren't thinking of - and to do that we need to be adaptable.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/maned-wolf.jpg\" alt=\"a photo of a maned wolf - it looks kind of like half deer, half fox\"> The maned wolf is real, and it is awesome.\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>So, experiments and failure to reach \"standard\" are actually good things - that's how we can get better by exploring the edges and learning.  But the original Web plan made it the norm that experimentations ship with browsers - out in the open, and usually very high level. That led to serious problems of miscommunication and frustration and interoperability challenges.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Polyfills showed us a different way forward though by mixing what little DNA we had exposed to us to fill the gaps.  If you could polyfill a feature because a few browsers didn't support it, you could just as easily fill it before <em>any</em> browser supported it.  Instead of proposing something that only works in a single browser - why not use the power of the Web to propose something that works in <em>all browsers.</em>  A <em>prollyfill (</em>will it become a standard? I dunno, prolly something like it).  Given lower level DNA, we can experiment.  The Extensible Web Manifesto calls this DNA \"Fundamental Primitives\" and it encourages standards to focus majority efforts on them.  Sometimes this may mean introducing new ones, but there's already a lot of rich DNA already locked away within the existing higher level APIs of the platform.  Exposing it means we have more raw materials and can prollyfill more and better experiments.  Beneath the existing features are all sorts of things that deal with network fetching, streaming, parsing, caching, layout, painting and so on.  Each of these is being currently being 'excavated'.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The huge shift in economics that this could create is amazing.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In the mid-2000's, a lot of people wanted something like flexbox.  It's only now, in 2016, that we can really begin to get broad feedback from developers who are largely just starting to see what they can use it for.  In all likelihood, they will find some faults and have some better ideas.  But if we could have <em>given</em> developers flexbox in a fashion that at least many of them could use to accomplish real things - that's a good incentive to be involved. The feedback loop could be tighted up considerably and it's possible because even if it fails to become a standard, it still <em>works to accomplish something.</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>Wait a minute.  Hold the presses.  Think about that for a moment:  Why do developers want to learn about standards?  To feel smart?  Shit no.  Developers want standards because they have work to get done.  A standard way is portable. \"Being standard\" means it's had a lot of eyeballs and ultimately it winds up being \"free\".  But if they can't use a standard, they'll use a library.  Why?  Because things have to get done.  Libraries have <em>many </em>of the same benefits, but not all.  A lot of people ask me \"why didn't we just standardize library X\".  The answer is generally simple: No library has been proposed as a standard, in a fashion compatible with standardization.  They're usually too big, there are IP issues, and at the end of the day lots of people feel like they didn't get a say.  But... If a proposal is delivered like a prollyfill that works everywhere, it's roughly that - only in the right form!</p>\n\n\t\t<p>What we need then is a way to <em>incubate </em>ideas, build prolyfills and somehow get lots of eyeballs, use and participation.  We need to see what sticks, and what can be better.  We need ideas to fail safely without breaking the economics of participation or breaking the Web<em>. </em> And we need standards to act more like<a href=\"https://briankardell.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/dropping-the-f-bomb/\"> dictionary editors</a> than startups.  I explain in the presentation that, in fact, most of their successes have been this and that the idea is not at all radical, but I'll spare you that here.</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">A million voices cried out...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Meetup.com has 4 million people signed up who call themselves Web developers.  How can we involve even thousands of them the way that we do standards now?  The answer is simple: We can't.  Discussing things on mailing lists while we wait forever for consensus and implementation doesn't scale.  An incubator would need people helping cream rise to the top - it needs <em>networked </em>communication.  Just as in networking, not all noise needs to be in all places.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Chapters.io is the answer (or at least the first attempt at an answer) to that problem.  Chapters is an effort to pair people who are involved with standards with meetups about the Web who can help them find, try, and discuss things that are in incubation (or proposed for incubation).  They provide a \"safe\" space for noisy and potentially less formal discussion.  Ideas can be collected, summarized and championed.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This is not a far flung dream: It is happening. The Extensible Web has helped shape ideas like the <a href=\"https://wicg.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Incubator Community Group</a> (WICG) which provides just such an outlet for incubation and the <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/03/houdini-maybe-the-most-exciting-development-in-css-youve-never-heard-of/\" target=\"_blank\">Houdini</a> Task Force. Browser makers and standardistas are making proposals there, and we're figuring out how to incubate them.  Good ideas find champions and move forward.  The WICG also provides a Discourse instance where developers can subscribe to and participate in a way a lot more plausible than a mailing list.  Very recently, the <a href=\"http://blog.jquery.com/2016/07/27/the-jquery-foundation-and-standards-2/\">jQuery Foundation announced that the standards team will be helping to establish, manage and champion chapters</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So what do you say?

This gene leads to development of an exotic protein which can radically affect other genes in unpredictable ways. The result is mutants with all sorts of different \"super\" abilities. This is the basis for the story lines in the X-Men comics. Some humans, without the X-gene, see mutants as freaks, there is prejudice against them. Others would like to recruit them as weapons. Still others are friends. The mutant community is divided too. One group of mutants believe that they are a new homo superior destined to become the dominant species and they're willing to earn this by fear and force. Another group of mutants, the X-Men, led by Professor Xavier, believe that mutants and non-mutants should live in harmony. Mutants powers can even aid humanity. They work very hard for the advancement of peace and tolerance. And then, there are quite a lot of people - both mutants and everydays humans who are torn back and forth somewhere in the middle on a lot of the subtleties that arise. One of the most amazing parts of the narrative is that the leaders of the two groups are actually best friends. They actually agree on much. Most of their followers are not similarly friendly. It's kind of a hot mess, and it reminds me a little of the Web community.</p>\n\n\t<p>I don't think it should be controversial to say \"we aren't really where we'd like to be\" on the Web. For some reason there seems to be more division that we'd like. Some would like to paint the future, or even the present, as being dark and desolate...</p>\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\">\n\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/fsztzvwcr6kpsmzcbjx2.jpg\" alt=\"A still from X-Men Days of Future Past in which the quote applies\">\n\t\tThe future: a dark, desolate world. A world of war, suffering, loss on both sides. Mutants, and the humans who dared to help them, fighting an enemy we cannot defeat. - Professor Xavier\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>However, I don't think that this is the case. It strikes me that our debates are as much about the past as they are about the future. Given this, it's worth stopping for a moment and assessing where we are, considering how we got to this place, and whether (and how) we will adapt.</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>Are we destined down this path, destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us? Or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves... change our fate? Is the future truly set?- Professor Xavier</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>For a little over 20 years, we have attempted to develop the vocabulary and features of HTML via a standards body. HTML was designed to give you the structure and function with a default look and feel. Author provided CSS prettied up the presentation. Because of this, with CSS disabled a user should, in theory, get a perfectly usable (if not very pretty) interface. Both HTML and CSS had forward-compatible parsers which effectively just ignore the stuff they don't understand. All of this is designed to make HTML work on the greatest number of browsers.</p>\n\n\t<p>Our lexicon has indeed increased, though, admittedly slowly. Unfortunately, even after reaching 'standard' even some of the authors don't agree on the proper use and meaning of some elements <code tag-esc=\"\">main</code> is an example of this. In other cases, things that made it through to the \"standard\" (recommendation) are implemented by no one (the document outline is an example of this), so writing markup assuming that is actually wrong. In still other cases, even when elements pass standards and are widely implemented and experts agree on how they should be used, actual developers misunderstand and use them differently on an all too common basis - <code tag-esc=\"\">address</code> and<code tag-esc=\"\">article</code> are examples of this.  Some very common UI metaphors still have no native definition to use (tabs are an example of this). Most native elements have some styling limitations, sometimes these are trivial but other times not: <code tag-esc=\"\">select</code>, for example, is unstylable in non-trivial ways - it is incapable of doing multi-line options or including any text formatting inside them. Some, like table-oriented elements, lack the semantics on their own (without ARIA attributes) to be meaningful enough for a screen reader to make sense of in a lot of cases, yet this is infrequently taught.</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>But there's more... let's go to the video...</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>In still other cases, combinations of these factors conspire against us, like the universe itself trying to keep us from success. For example: The vast majority of browsers have supported the <code tag-esc=\"\">video</code> element for some time. Someone following lots of conventional advice would think that markup like this would be a pretty safe bet.</p>\n\n\t<code-format type=\"html\"><pre>&lt;video crossorigin=\"anonymous\" poster=\"http://cdn.example.com/link/to/poster.jpg\"&gt;\n  &lt;a href=\"http://cdn.example.com/link/to/video.blah\"&gt;\n    Download my video of a cat playing with a grape.\n  &lt;/a&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;track kind=\"captions\"\n    label=\"English captions\"\n    src=\"https://cdn.example.com/link/to/video-en.vtt\"&gt;\n  &lt;/track&gt;\n&lt;/video&gt;\n</pre></code-format>\n\n\t<p>In theory at least, unsupporting browsers would show a link.  A user clicking it would be prompted to download it, and then they could play it with their favorite media player (an even relatively recent OS would even help them find one if they didn't have one). Browsers that did support <code tag-esc=\"\">video</code> would just go ahead and use it.  With no JavaScript and no author provided CSS at all, a simple, declarative HTML document can give you a pretty valid experience on just about every browser ever made and accessibility would be free.</p>\n\n\t<p>But actually, that's wrong. In fact, <em>regardless of whether you had a new browser or an old one in early 2016, your native <code tag-esc=\"\">video</code>  element would be inaccessible!</em> It didn't really \"work\" to some extent or other. That is, if the user of a screen reader had an old browser, they could download the video, but not connect it to the captions files.</p>\n\n\t<p>Ouch, that is suck.</p>\n\n\t<p>But even if the user of a screen reader had a \"modern\" browser it was still potentially problematic: IE11 would fail to download the captions, regardless of whether you included the right CORS headers.</p>\n\n\t<p>Sigh, IE. Double Suck.</p>\n\n\t<p>Even outside of that, however, the player in all browsers but Chrome was not keyboard accessible.</p>\n\n\t<p>Triple suck.</p>\n\n\t<p>Oh yeah, did I mention that you can't style the controls of the player when it is embedded?</p>\n\n\t<p>Quadruple suck.</p>\n\n\t<p>But...</p>\n\n\t<p>We left out an important detail. If this was really the only option, HTML 5 might still be lingering as something we 'hoped' to achieve. The truth is that there are still commonly used HTML 5 bits that are not universally implemented even in modern browsers. The implementation space is, was, and always will be ragged. The aspect that launched a thousand ships with HTML uptake was the polyfill. Key to the polyfill, of course, is JavaScript. </p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">If the Web had an \"X-Gene\" it would be JavaScript.</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Yes, the X-Gene can give you powers that are seriously abused. Yes, people might use their powers in not super ways. They might even do something like try to drop a stadium on the White House...</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\" id=\"s\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t<video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" controls=\"\" data-src=\"/media/magneto-lifting-stadium\">\n\t\t\t</video>\n\t\t\tPlease, don't try to drop a stadium on the White House)\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>But it can also give us powers to do good things, like, you know... Save the world. You might have noticed that there are a number of sites using the <code tag-esc=\"\">video</code> element that are perfectly accessible when used with a modern browser, and styled when embedded as well. That's possible because of JavaScript. JavaScript made a solution that was more accessible possible. It's a nice thing to say \"It should work in really old browsers, even without JavaScript enabled\" but the truth is, that doesn't match where we are in a lot of cases. Saying \"you don't have to use a modern browser or have JavaScript enabled... unless you are disabled\" seems like... I don't know, kind of a dick move.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>This is the reality of where we actually are as I see it.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Enter: Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left share-image optional\">\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/x-web-first-class.jpg\" alt=\"Professor's Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters Logo\">\n\t\t\t\tX-Web: First class.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>In the comics, Professor Xavier runs a \"School for Gifted Youngsters\". A place whose purpose Marvel's wiki describes as \"train young mutants in controlling their powers and help foster a friendly human-mutant relationship.\" What if we could learn to harness our powers for good? What would it look like? If, as in Days of Future Past, we could go back in time and apply those same lessons, what kind of difference could that make - and is it worth applying them now?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>The past: a new and uncertain world. A world of endless possibilities and infinite outcomes. Countless choices define our fate: each choice, each moment, a moment in the ripple of time. Enough ripple, and you change the tide... for the future is never truly set. - Professor Xavier</blockquote>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Extensible Web Manifesto </a>stresses the duality of ideas that <em>we want developers to write more declarative code, not less</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>we want browsers to focus on low-level-features. </em> Those things can seem at odds, unless you understand the intent. JavaScript is already a superpower. Very much Web as we know it could not rightly exist without it, no matter how much we'd like to pretend otherwise. Without JavaScript, there are no polyfills. Without JavaScript, there are unresolvable accessibility issues. We might wish it weren't so, but it is.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>What good is spending years debating whether we should have a high level element, followed by years of ragged implementation that we couldn't patch, followed by years of unhappiness that it still doesn't give us what we want.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-right optional\">\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/x-men-days-of-future-past-storm-wallpaper.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Imagine then, that we could go back in time - low level features exposed and the ability to mint custom elements. Imagine, if you can, that this was part of the Web from Day One. It's a big ask of the imagination, I realize, but it requires no more suspension of belief than time travel or a genetic mutation that somehow grants its possessor control over the weather, and we find that entertaining, so try to follow along...</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Would we have the vocabulary that we have today? Doubtful. We'd have addressed these issues with experience by now. This is the ultimate goal of prioritizing the low-level-features -- so that we can actually figure out the high level in a sane way. <em>We want low-level features exposed because we want developers to <a href=\"https://briankardell.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/dropping-the-f-bomb/\">help us define new vocabulary</a>.  W</em>ould we have debates about whether you should count on JavaScript? I don't think so. It can fail to download - but so can your page midway through and that's no good either. There are ways we can reduce that likelihood and improve performance too, and we're working on it. It can have an error, but in truth, so can a Web browser's native code. The trouble is that we have no common, good way to currently find and evaluate high quality custom elements. However, if this became common practice - if it had been a thing since Day One - we'd have solved that by now, 25 years in.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Given a better vocabulary, things that currently require authors to write complex HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be simplified. We can say more with less.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That's good for authors.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That's good for accessibility.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That's good for performance.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That's good for slow connections.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>JavaScript is not the enemy, it's the the killer asset. I'd also like authors to have to write less of it by harnessing common high level, preferably declarative code.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>This is the present I wish that we had. Unfortunately, changing the past is only an option in fantasy. What we can do, however, is learn the lessons and make today the new Day 0, and begin a new timeline. Not disconnected from the past, but with a different path forward.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>We have the powers, now let's learn to use them really well. What we really need is a Professor Xavier's Home for Gifted Youngsters where we can go to find the quality X-Web. This problem is the one I'm most interested in. <a href=\"https://wicg.io\" target=\"_blank\">wicg.io</a> is a step in the right direction.

This gene leads to development of an exotic protein which can radically affect other genes in unpredictable ways. The result is mutants with all sorts of different \"super\" abilities. This is the basis for the story lines in the X-Men comics. Some humans, without the X-gene, see mutants as freaks, there is prejudice against them. Others would like to recruit them as weapons. Still others are friends. The mutant community is divided too. One group of mutants believe that they are a new homo superior destined to become the dominant species and they're willing to earn this by fear and force. Another group of mutants, the X-Men, led by Professor Xavier, believe that mutants and non-mutants should live in harmony. Mutants powers can even aid humanity. They work very hard for the advancement of peace and tolerance. And then, there are quite a lot of people - both mutants and everydays humans who are torn back and forth somewhere in the middle on a lot of the subtleties that arise. One of the most amazing parts of the narrative is that the leaders of the two groups are actually best friends. They actually agree on much. Most of their followers are not similarly friendly. It's kind of a hot mess, and it reminds me a little of the Web community.",

What a lot of people don't know, however, is that two decades before Edison, a man named √âdouard-L√©on Scott de Martinville invented, used and patented a means for recording sound waves.  The \"phonautograph,\"  as he called it, used vibrations from a brush to capture the sound waves from within a cone to make lines on soot covered paper as it passed along a rotating drum.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>If you've never heard of the phonautograph, you're probably thinking \"wow... that's amazing!?  How did one play it back?\" Of course, that's a natural question.  What could be more natural?  So you'll probably be shocked to learn \"you couldn't\".</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Let that sink in for a moment.  The man invented a sound recorder that couldn't be played back.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Why would someone even invent such a thing?  To understand that, you'll have to some mental gymnastics and put yourself back in Scott's world.  Until that time, people had been recording things for thousands of years - by <em>writing it down</em>.  Sound was an expression of thoughts from your brain, through your voice.  There were lots of alphabets and even things like stenography which Scott had studied that made it more efficient.  Words were made of phonemes.  In all these cases, by transforming the phonemes into an alphabet, our brain learned to make sense of these markings via our eyes, rather than our ears.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Scott just assumed that if he could manage to get the soundwaves \"written down\" then people could just learn to \"read\" soundwaves.  He spent a lot of time on this, and, in terms of reaching his proposed destination, <em>he failed kind of epicly:  </em>You can't read soundwaves with your eyes.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Except that, as we see from this vantage point, he didn't.  While he couldn't even see or conceive of \"playback,\" his work enabled others to see further.  <em>As a side note - many many years later, when we got to where we have computers that could be made to 'read' a sound wave, a team actually did just that and '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBL7V3zGMUA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=44s\" target=\"_blank\">played back</a>' some of Scott's recordings.  The quality is pretty terrible, as you might expect, but it is undeniable that he was successfully recording.</em></p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Our Inability To See the Future</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Our ability to see the future is, as we just saw, very tied to our place in time and our current perspective.  Very frequently, in trying to solve one problem, we are affecting another.  If we measure \"failure\" by intent to complete what we set out to do, it's truly astonishing how much around us that we'd typically view as huge success was actually rooted in \"failure\".  When he created sound recording and playback, Edison imagined that people would use it for correspondence.  Again, his world was a world of writing and mail.  He prognosticated that a fine and probably common use of his technology would be for someone to record a \"letter\" and pop it in the mail.  When Bell invented the telephone he imagined that it might be used to pipe music from a performance to an audience remotely.  When people got their hands on both, they were basically used inversely.  Meanwhile, Lee de Forest who helped pioneer AM radio, had imagined something so different that he sent a letter to National Association of Broadcasters saying \"\"What have you done with my child, the radio broadcast? You have debased this child, dressed him in rags of ragtime, tatters of jive and boogie-woogie.\"  Ever used super glue?  That isn't what he was trying to invent.  Not remotely.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Have a look-see here...</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sir Tim Berners-Lee thinks that if we can predict what the internet will look like in 20 years, than we are not creative enough. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/www2016?src=hash\">#www2016</a></p>‚Äî Dragan Milchevski (@Agandrau) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Agandrau/status/720260781481308161\">April 13, 2016</a></blockquote>\n\t\t<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\t\t<p>That's pretty relevant because in many ways the Web today is hardly what Tim Berners-Lee was trying to accomplish at all.  Tim imagined that browsers would be equal parts authoring environments and that the Web would be a very two-way medium.  Instead, it has been until recently, very one way.  And it still isn't a real editing environment as imagined.  Tim imagined annotations, we've still not got those, really.  In fact, some early browsers had them and took them out.  Tim didn't initially see scripting, nor CSS nor HTML <em>being</em> the content so much.  His initial use case was research, yet still, I can't find most scientific research available in HTML format.  By the measure of accomplishing the goals of the time, the Web is kind of a failure... But is it?  No way.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Failure vs Death</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>he death of the Web would mean it was over, done.  But failure is something different, or at least it can be.  Failure can be good. It's necessary even.  If you are capable of seeing or hearing this post, it's only the result of millions of failures in DNA and the consequence of a process with no long-term vision at all - just an inherent bias toward not dying long enough to reproduce.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But the really interesting thing to note is that this is possible only because failures breed opportunity.  The entire universe (but especially humanity) seems very adept at finding opportunity and exploiting it.  The general trend then is usually, at least from the perspective of those viewing it, \"up\" as we capitalize on an increasing number of opportunities.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>By these measures, the Web already <em>is</em> a spectacular failure.  Emphasis on the word \"spectacular\".  It's absolutely great in some ways, but not quite exactly as intended in the first draft.  Even Tim's vision of what the Web could, should or might possibly be is affected by what's all around.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Seeing the difference between the two (death and failure), however, kind of matters.  The reason that the Web isn't going to die, in my opinion, is that it is learning this lesson.  All of the major Web Standards Bodies have \"adopted\" the <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\" target=\"_blank\">Extensible Web Manifesto</a> and they're hard at work taking the stuff that works and just exposing more opportunity DNA.  The W3C Technical Architecture Group (TAG) is helping to make sure that W3C projects keep this in mind and don't go off the track with spec reviews and community and working group-coordinated efforts like <a href=\"https://extensiblewebreportcard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Extensible Web Report Card</a> and task forces like <a href=\"https://dev.opera.com/articles/houdini/\" target=\"_blank\">Houdini</a>.  Friends at the WHATWG are doing lots of hard work explaining nitty-gritty details and getting those hard last-mile agreements on ideas like Streams and Fetch.  ECMA provides prollyfills and transpilers before specs are finished and accepts feedback  The W3C Web Incubator Community Group provides a place for lots of ideas <em>from anywhere </em>to take root, be discussed, prollyfilled and, frequently usefully used before they take deep roots in standards... And importantly<em> to fail.  It </em>offers value along the way and provides new opportunities, which begin to let us see the future more clearly.  Finally, the W3C Advisory Board (AB) is working on changes to the W3C Process which would require <em>all </em>of the things to be incubated.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>I think that the Web has a bright and vibrant future ahead, full of beautiful failures.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<p class=\"thanksTo\"><em>Note, if you enjoyed the stories of failure in this piece, I'd highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Got-Now-Innovations/dp/1594632960\">\"</a></em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-We-Got-Now-Innovations/dp/1594632960\"><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-extra-large\">How We Got to Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World\" by Steven Johnson.</span></a></p>\n\n",

AT&amp;T has purchased Go and PenOS (see&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">Part I: The Pre-Web</a>) and now they are pulling the plug. &nbsp;SmartSketch FutureSplash (again, Part I) won't be released. Its makers Jonathan Gay and Charlie Jackson briefly try porting to the desktop, but there they would have to compete with well-funded and mature products and that isn't practical. &nbsp;Keep them in the back of your mind, we'll come back to them.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>For the past few years, Tim Berners-Lee's \"Web\" concept has experienced increasing growth month over month thanks to a number of large number of contributing factors (see <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-3.html\">Part III: The Early Web</a>). Still, its&nbsp;audience is comparatively almost microscopic by 2016 standards and mainly composed of academics and hard-core internet and markup enthusiasts. But, to put this into perspective: Just having a computer at home remains a pretty novel concept, even in America. Studies reveal that where they do exist they are frequently underused. While it's true that from 1984 to 1994 the percentage of homes with a PC tripled, it is still only 1 in 4 &nbsp;US homes that has a computer. Of those, many don't have modems or any kind of internet access. Only about 2% of Americans have access to the internet from home. Of this, only a small fraction are using the Web.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t<img src=\"/media/early-households-with-internet-chart.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>Note carefully&nbsp;that that 2% represents <em>all internet access - not just the Web. &nbsp;</em>Very many people are getting on the \"internet\" through an online service. &nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few months ago, America Online began direct mailing disks to people encouraging them to get online. It now has advertisers and 1 million members, many of whom are not the same crowd as the Web right now. The world is confused about the Internet, online services like AOL and the Web, but this isn't all bad news for the Web. It introduces a whole lot of people to the idea of getting \"online\" and Moore's law continues to lessen the price of computers and more and more of them are coming with increasingly capable modems. &nbsp;Even now, however,&nbsp;t<em>he Web itself (including work and home) only accounts for only about 2.5% of Internet traffic.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\t<p>Given the small size, the number of browsers that have sprung up is truly astonishing, and each has extended Tim's original definition of HTML with their own ideas. A few people, like Dan Connolly, have been actively working on trying to hammer down agreements and a base standard. Over the past year however a new dominant factor has emerged: <em>Mosaic</em>.</p>\n\n\t<p>Of those that are using the Web at this point, estimates are as high as 97% of them are now using the Mosaic browser (see <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-3.html\">Part III: The Early Web</a>) which is available on many platforms and comparatively easy to install thanks to the hard work of folks like Marc Andreessen, Eric Bina, Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser and Aleks Totic. It's name has become so synonymous with using the Web that the line between the two has become blurred: Even people who are interested in the Web begin to ask if you're \"on Mosaic\" instead of \"on the Web\".</p>\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">\"Web Time...\"</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>The next few months is almost a blur, so much happened so fast. This pace would become known to some as \"Web time\".</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/netscape1994.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\tA screenshot of the Netscape home page from 1994 featuring an early \"Mozilla\" monster\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>In March 1994, Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) founder Jim Clark &nbsp;begins&nbsp;working on a business venture with Mosaic creator Marc Andreessen. They'll hire up a lot of talent from both SGI and NCSA and they're working on some server products and, more importantly a commercial browser built to kill Mosaic. &nbsp;Initially it is called \"MCOM\" (Mosaic Communications). &nbsp;Internally, the browser project is&nbsp;called \"Mozilla\" (a name given to it by another co-founder, Jamie Zawinski, who would go on to write much of the Unix version of their 1.0 browser) or \"Mosaic-killer\". &nbsp;As you might imagine, the MCOM name was a problem and so \"Netscape\" was born. &nbsp;Very early Netscape website (while still in the mcom.com domain) even featured a \"Mozilla\" character originally created by employee Dave Titus.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Two months later in May, NCSA hands off licensing of&nbsp;Mosaic to Spyglass, Inc. - a commercial offshoot of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign built to monetize research there. Spyglass would license the Mosaic product for modification and distribution. &nbsp;At least one of those licenses will come back and change things again very soon...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That same month, the first World Wide Web Conference is held. Attended by 380 people from around the world. &nbsp;Unsurprisingly, overwhelmingly made-up of technically enthusiastic academics. Thanks in large part to Dan Connolly's presentation entitled \"Interoperability: Why Everyone Wins\" it launched the first very serious efforts behind creating an HTML standard. However, by this point, just what the baseline should be is very fuzzy: Almost no-one stuck&nbsp;to Tim's original specifications to begin with and some aspects of it already seem defunct. &nbsp; HTML has been re-spec'ed into an actual implementation of SGML, except still not quite really... Some browsers (even Tim's now) have inline images thanks to hard-pulling/pioneering work by Marc Andreessen. Some have tables, some had forms. &nbsp;Dave Raggett has a proposal called HTML+ which contains a lot of this. &nbsp;Further adding to the challenge, Tim Berners-Lee has also begun talks of starting a consortium modeled after the x-consortium designed to help the Web remain open, competitive and interoperable.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Meanwhile, Sun Microsystem's Green Team (see <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-2.html\">Part II: Time</a> and <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-3.html\">Part III: The Early Web</a>) has been given a new lease on life by the success of Mosaic. They imagine a Web in which \"write once, run anywhere\" applications could be delivered regardless of the user's operating system because of their Oak VM (later \"Java\") - and their foot in the door will also be a Mosaic competitor: \"WebRunner\" (soon \"HotJava\") which the team is getting increasingly excited about.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The summer was abuzz with talks of styling too. &nbsp;With more authors creating content and finding new uses, a typewritten page seemed pretty insufficient. &nbsp;SGML didn't really have a single standard but it had helped create a small group of what appeared to be reasonably successful ideas and from these discussions there came&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/Style/History/Overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">a myriad of proposals</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Two months later, in July 1994, Dan Connolly presents HTML 2.0 at an IETF meeting in Toronto, an IETF Working group is formed. &nbsp;But in October, two key factors emerged: First, an agreement to start the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is signed setting up the eventual future question of where the HTML standard will live and what the relevant roles will be. &nbsp;Second, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hakon W Lie proposes \"CSS\"</a> which will become one of the first targets of the new W3C.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In November 1994, HTML finally received an IETF identifier: <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866\" target=\"_blank\">RFC-1866</a>.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Money</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>There was a lot of speculation about how one might make money with the Web, but 1994 put some real ideas to the test.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Ads</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>On&nbsp;October 27, 1994, HotWired.com launched the first major banner ads, including a campaign that looked like this:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image share-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/first-ever-banner-ad.gif\" alt=\"The first ever banner ad saying 'Have you ever clicked your mouse right here? You will.\">\n\t\t\t\tThe first ever banner ad\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>It was the first real, modern(ish) attempt to apply the advertising model that had worked for TV, newspapers, magazines, etc - to&nbsp;the Web. If you're using the Web in 2016 as you're reading this, you're probably aware that this is how the vast majority of Web content is funded, and it's pretty debatable whether the Web would still exist in anything remotely resembling its current form without ads. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because the Web had no payment or compensation model. &nbsp;In fact, not only did it have&nbsp;no concept of how you could monetize, the insecure nature of HTTP, the protocol that made it possible, effectively made things like privacy, which are necessary for transactions,&nbsp;nearly impossible.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Licensing, Commerce and the Netscape Factor</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>One&nbsp;could reasonably make the case that Netscape changed everything. &nbsp;It was about this same time (late 1994)&nbsp;that&nbsp;Netscape began&nbsp;releasing beta versions of Netscape Navigator. Within just a few months it overtook&nbsp;Mosaic as the dominant browser in 1.0. Very much like all browsers before it, Netscape innovated and added its own tags to HTML which are part of neither HTML 2.0 nor the new HTML 3.0 specifications (notably <code tag-esc=\"\">font</code> and <code tag-esc=\"\">center</code>). \"What's that\" you say, \"3.0?! Where did that come from?!\". As you might expect, history doesn't stand still - things that weren't included in the pending HTML 2.0 standard are being collated into a possible HTML 3.0 standard. As the now dominant force, however, and with the increasing growth of the community being introduced to HTML without past knowledge and theory - and this is critical: It actually&nbsp;made&nbsp;it possible to do things that everyone actually wanted. &nbsp;Regardless of how it accomplished it, these things made the Web a <em>lot</em> more interesting. &nbsp;<em>A hack that works and can get used, as it turns out, is of&nbsp;considerably more practical value than theoretical purity that doesn't. &nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>As a commercial endeavor, Netscape realizes that they need to make e-commerce possible and the Web commercially viable. As plain-text, HTTP wasn't going to cut it. Netscape/Dr. Taher Elgamal's SSL is the result, but before version 1.0 can ship it's realized that there are serious concerns and so, a lot like it was with HTML, SSL 2.0 is the first one most people hear about. It is released in February 1995 and if you were there, it might have looked something like this:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ojmng198Ni0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\t\t\t\t<div>A video of early Netscape in action</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That same month the HTML 2.0 specifications are revised at IETF in hopes of actually getting something passed. Changes are mostly around MIME, encoding an improved DTD and simple formatting.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ae02.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>By March 1995 Sun was giving some demos to people outside and \"Java\" was&nbsp;starting to make news. &nbsp;The San Jose Mercury News ran a front-page piece entitled \"<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/19961220215426/http://www.sjmercury.com/archives/hotjava.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Why Sun thinks Hot Java will give you a lift</a>\". &nbsp;Sun released Java for public download&nbsp;and in short order Sun's T1 line were&nbsp;so saturated that developers weren't able to download. The piece explains that browsers are dumb (not to have, just not especially capable) and in the piece, Marc Andreessen is quoted giving it praise.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Thinking that a browser that viewed HTML was \"dumb\" wasn't new. &nbsp;As explained in <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">Part I: The Pre-Web</a>, there were plenty of more capable hypermedia systems <em>before</em> HTML. &nbsp;As explained in <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-2.html\">Part II: Time</a>, Tim didn't <em>expect</em> HTML to be the whole thing he just thought that the \"dumb\" parts would be&nbsp;the ones that connected everything. &nbsp;As explained in <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-3.html\">Part III: The Early Web</a>, others like Pei Wei had already shipped a browser capable of doing embedded programs very much like applets. And Midas, developed at Stanford, had sort of pioneered the idea of plugins (it could display postscript). &nbsp;Again, this wasn't shocking, but rather seemed exciting to Tim. &nbsp;So, unbeknownst to developers at Sun, but certainly unsurprisingly: &nbsp;Certain players at Netscape have <em>also</em> been thinking about the need for a&nbsp;less-dumb&nbsp;imperative language in the browser.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Netscape folks from SGI like Jim Clark and Kipp Hickman&nbsp;have been courting an enterprising engineer named Brendan Eich (also an SGI alumnus) with the lure of doing \"Scheme in the browser\". You might think that this means that Brendan was an advanced Scheme developer, but that's not the case at all. In fact, he had no practical professional experience with Scheme at all. Instead, Brendan was something of a language nerd and saw a lot of promising things in Scheme that were&nbsp;lacking in other languages and he was interested in seeing what he could do. Quietly, and without fanfare, he left&nbsp;MicroUnity for Netscape in April 1995. &nbsp;Netscape who was just releasing Navigator&nbsp;1.1 which, as noted in&nbsp;<em>Information&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;</em>contained what would be a new bit of DNA:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>Netscape Navigator 1.1 includes sophisticated new features such as the Netscape Client Application Programming Interface (NCAPI) for easy integration with third party applications, advanced layout capabilities for more visually compelling pages, dynamic document updating for changing information and enhanced security features.\n\t\t\t\t<div> - <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-16926084/netscape-unveils-netscape-navigator-1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Information Today, April 1995</a></div>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The plugin architecture, developed in large part&nbsp;by John Giannandrea (now working on Search / Deep AI at Google) spurred&nbsp;a lot of excitement: A number of companies quickly got to work, including Macromedia - the maker of the popular Director software (see <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-I.html\">Part I: The Pre-Web</a>), Real Networks and Sun.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Unfortunately, by the time Brendan started, Marc Andreessen has also begun talks with Sun to license their Java Virtual Machine (VM) for redistribution within the Navigator browser, for embedding applications. Given this and some unfortunate headcount issues, Brendan is initially placed on the <em>server</em> team.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>It's May 1995 before Brendan is moved to the client team and begins work on a project code-named \"Mocha\". Certain factions within Netscape are scheming for a possible alternative to Java. If your first reaction is \"why?\" let me explain: People like Brendan and Andreessen realize Java is rather close to C++ and this is very unlike the Web so far which is pretty easy for amateurs and beginners to get started with. Writing code in Java requires a developer with an understanding of compilation, classes, data types, a main method, packages and so on. Microsoft is making a lot of headway in expanding the number of people who can program, by contrast with Visual Basic. \"The Web needs something like that\", they argued. For that kind of idea to really work, they decided that it would be necessary to be able to code right there in the page. It would have to be interpreted, not compiled. It would have to have simpler qualities. &nbsp;In order to keep the project alive, get funding and not destroy other potentially lucrative avenues with the Sun agreement, they realize that he will have to pretty quickly show that it is possible to do a language in the browser, show that it isn't redundant with Java.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>While he hasn't started anything, Brendan has been quietly thinking about this since before he came on: What kind of language would work? &nbsp;Being a language buff, he knows the history of languages and bits about their theory. &nbsp;He is drawn particularly to languages like Self. &nbsp;Most programmers have heard references to Xerox-PARC's Smalltalk as being way ahead of its time and elegant, but certain people at Xerox-PARC went on to work on better&nbsp;models, among them,&nbsp;Self. &nbsp;David Ungar pioneered the idea of reducing the number of concepts and maximizing their utility. &nbsp;Self was prototypal and that was appealing. &nbsp;Brendan was also drawn to aspects of HyperTalk, the programming language available for the wildly successful HyperCard (see&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-I.html\">Part I: The Pre-Web</a>) for inspiration on&nbsp;how you could put these things together in a way that amateurs could glue things together.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>And so, in 10 days in May 1995, Brendan put together <em>just enough:</em> &nbsp;The core language parser, interpreter, decompiler, and minimal standard library core language. &nbsp;He integrated it via Lou Montulli's protocol handler (Lou Montelli was another Netscape founder who also co-authored the Lynx browser). &nbsp;Using these , Brendan created a demo in which you could use it&nbsp;as a protocol in the browser's URL bar. &nbsp;If you've ever done <code>javascript:alert('hello world')</code> or something you're using a similar idea. Here, however, typing the protocol <code>mocha:</code> would launch a primitive frameset based console.&nbsp; Using this Brendan was able to give a demo that would&nbsp;both generate&nbsp;enough interest and allay concerns of redundancy with Java. &nbsp;It wouldn't officially become \"JavaScript\" until Bill Joy of Sun signed the trademark license with Marc, Brendan and Rick Schell (Netscape VP of Engineering) later on December 4, 1995. &nbsp;For convenience, we'll still refer to it as JavaScript.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>A few more challenges for JavaScript: &nbsp;First, the Netscape browser (nor really any browser save perhaps Viola) had been written to have an embedded scripting language intertwined in the mix. As a result, Brendan compared trying to shoehorn this in in a rush to juggling with chainsaws. &nbsp;Why the rush? &nbsp;well, that's the second challenge: &nbsp;It would have to ship in the same release as Java (Netscape 2). &nbsp; Here's why:&nbsp; Because while&nbsp;the tech world is abuzz about both Netscape and Sun,&nbsp;yesterday's talk about the rising power that was Microsoft has turned into speculation that Bill Gates has missed the boat. &nbsp;Everyone knows that it's just a matter of time before Microsoft leans in and attempts to stake claim, and the best way to prevent that is to be too good and too well entrenched by the time it arrives. &nbsp;People at&nbsp;Netscape realize that if they can't get a firm grasp on the market, Microsoft will just eat them up. &nbsp; That same month, Bill Gates&nbsp;sends a lengthy internal Memo titled \"<a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/internet-tidal-wave.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Internet Tidal&nbsp;Wave</a>\" setting precisely those priorities - and Microsoft licenses Mosaic from SpyGlass and \"Internet Explorer\" is conceived.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Netscape 2 also shipped with NPAPI - a plugin architecture that used the protocol handler to associate another, helper program for understanding, handling and (potentially) rendering other kinds of non-HTML content.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>At the August SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on GRAPHics and Interactive Techniques) conference that year Steve Jobs gave the keynote. &nbsp;He&nbsp;had bought Pixar and they were&nbsp;doing incredibly interesting things - including working with Disney to produce the first full-length computer animated feature: Toy Story. &nbsp;But a lot of the talk was about the internet and the Web. &nbsp;James Gosling of Java fame sat on a panel called&nbsp;Set-Top Boxes - The Next Platform\" in which he said:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>It's madness out there... My personal guess is that there will never be 'intelligent set top boxes'.\n\t\t\t<div>-<a href=\"http://www.siggraph.org/s95/PANELS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\"> James Gosling SIGGRAPH 1995 (page 5)</a></div>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Another panel was called \"Visualizing the Internet: Putting the User in the Driver‚Äôs Seat\" and it really centered a lot on \"Wow, this WWW thing is really taking off and it kind of looks like shit.\" &nbsp;Jonathan Gay who opened our piece was there too and heard a lot of people saying that the internet needed a really good vector based animation product. &nbsp;Netscape's NPAPI gave him the tool that he needed and his product was rebranded as \"FutureSplash Animator\" and the \"FutureSplash plugin\". &nbsp;Just start removing letters and you might sense where this is evolving before we get there in Part V. &nbsp;<em>Note: If you want to get a jump on it, it turns out that after posting I discovered that my friend Rick Waldron wrote<a href=\"http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/the_flash_history/\" target=\"_blank\"> a whole piece on exactly this subject </a>about 16 years ago.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>On August 9, 1995, Netscape made an initial public offering and the world, to put it mildly,<em> went nuts.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><em>Special thanks to friends like Brendan Eich, Chris Wilson and Simon St Laurent for helping fill gaps, stay honest and fix typos. &nbsp;Especially Brendan, without whom this post would not have been possible on many levels.</em>\n\n\t\t</p></section>\n\n\n\t</section>\n\n\n",

I'd like to talk about one of those I recently uncovered...</p>\n\n\t<p>A long long time ago, in a browser far far away, Brendan Eich introduced what would become known as \"DOM Level 0\" - basically: Simple reflective properties that allowed you to access useful bits of what would later become \"DOM\" and twiddle with them. &nbsp;It looked something like this...</p>\n\n\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t<pre>document.forms[0].firstName.value = \"Brian\";</pre>\n\t</code-format>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tHowever, there is a long, complex and twisted history that led us to where we are today (see my&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">A Brief(-ish) History of the Web Universe</a>&nbsp;series of posts). &nbsp;To sum up some key bits: CSS and the actual DOM were conceived of separately from thoughts of DOM0 and JavaScript. &nbsp;Unlike its predecessor, the \"real\" DOM was intended to be generic.  Part of this was just trying to bring a lot of people together and \"fix\" the Web.  At the time of its conception, there was a lot of focus on trying to address the problems of SGML that made HTML so appealing in the first place - so we got DTDs for HTML and work began on all things XML.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe \"real\" DOM, then, was intended to serve all masters, and as such it&nbsp;dealt with basic attributes in a tree which could be serialized, manipulated and parsed and rewritten in any language with a common interface.  This&nbsp;meant that authors would use <code>getAttribute(attributeName)</code> and <code>setAttribute(attributeName, value)</code> to get and set attribute values respectively. &nbsp;It seemed to those spec writers, then&nbsp;absolutely logical to create an attribute called \"<code>class</code>\" and allow a user to type:\n\t</p>\n\n\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t<pre>element.setAttribute(\"class\", \"intro\")</pre>\n\t</code-format>\n\n\t<p>Which would be serializable or parsable as something like</p>\n\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t<pre>&lt;div class=\"intro\"&gt;</pre>\n\t</code-format>\n\n\n\t<p>This was problematic in the browser though because DOM Level 0 was not only&nbsp;more well known, but far more&nbsp;terse/convenient.  Most authors really just wanted to deal with reflective properties and type something like:</p>\n\n\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t<pre>element.class = \"intro\";</pre>\n\t</code-format>\n\n\t<p>In CSS, the <code>class</code> attribute has special meaning, surely it deserved some sugar.  But the above wouldn't have worked because at the time, using property names that were JavaScript reserved words just wouldn't work.  To resolve all these issues, we got the <code>.className</code> property&nbsp;which was reflective on the <code>class</code> attribute. &nbsp;Problem solved... Except, not.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Not Simple Enough</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>CSS says that any element can specify&nbsp;0...N classes, not 0 or 1.  These are provided in a space separated list. &nbsp;In SGML/XML terms these were \"<code>NMTokens</code>\". &nbsp;It sounds quite simple - a space separated list of values with some simple constraints should work everywhere, and it does... kind of.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In the browser world, however, where we were messing with&nbsp;classes at runtime all over the place that needed to be reflected back (CSS wasn't based on&nbsp;runtime properties, it was based on&nbsp;attributes) we began facing issues. &nbsp;Someone would come along and write code like the above example, which assumed that it was a single value:</p>\n\n\t\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t\t<pre>element.className = \"intro\";</pre>\n\t\t</code-format>\n\n\t\t<p>The net result being that any existing class names at the time of execution were replaced with just one. &nbsp;Some other person would assume they wanted to toggle a value and write something like:</p>\n\n\t\t<code-format type=\"javascript\">\n\t\t\t<pre>// Toggle the 'selected' class\nelement.className = (element.className === \"selected\") ? \"\" : \"selected\";</pre>\n\t\t</code-format>\n\n\t\t<p>The problem being two-fold: &nbsp;First, it assumes it could === a single value, the second being that it can overwrite all the others. &nbsp;We had problems removing classes, adding them, removing them, toggling them, finding out if it contained something. &nbsp;It sounds trivial but it turns out that it wasn't: Each time you wanted to touch the className you had to deal with deserializing the string, doing your work and re-serializing it without stepping on any of a number of landmines. &nbsp;The net result was, as one might expect, we came up with libraries to help with this - however, they varied in quality and assumptions.

Problem Solved?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Sadly, I think still not quite. &nbsp;While it's a major improvement, the trouble is that the <code>NMTokens</code> issue does not solely affect the <code>class</code> attribute, or even just in JavaScript, but we only exposed it through <code>.classList</code>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's quite possible that you are thinking \"Well, this probably isn't something I need to worry about because I've never come across it\". &nbsp;However, I think you will, and that's the problem.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>There are other <code>NMTokens</code> issues that you've probably not thought about before but eventually will have to. &nbsp;Accessibility is a good example of where this pops up a lot, and if you've not thought about accessibility in the past, it's very possible you've never run into it for that reason alone.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute is just one example.  A control can be described by multiple elements for different purposes. &nbsp;For example, an <code tag-esc=\"\">input</code> element may have associated helpful advice that appears in a tooltip popup&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>associated constraint validation errors. &nbsp;Further, it works a lot like the <code>class</code> attribute and has similar challenge&nbsp;in JavaScript in that it frequently has to be actively maintained, not just written in markup, and that's deceptively hard. &nbsp;For example, an author should not associate an input with an errors collection until there are actually errors.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>This sucks. &nbsp;ARIA is hard enough without re-facing remedial seeming sorts of challenges that are indentical to once we've already solved.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Good News and Bad</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>The good news is that standards makers had the foresight to create an interface for this type of problem called <code>DOMTokenList</code> with all the useful methods and properties that <code>.classList</code> exposes. &nbsp;The <code>.classList</code> property holds a <code>DOMTokenList</code>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The bad news is that it's pretty much locked away and there's no way to easily re-apply it to new things as they emerge. &nbsp;We could continue to identify spec properties and create new things&nbsp;like <code>.classList</code> each time we find them. &nbsp;For example, we could expose <code>.ariaDescribedByList</code> - and we might want to occasionally do that - but it's not great. &nbsp;It's just additive. &nbsp;Each time we do, the API of things to learn gets bigger, it also doesn't expose these abilities to custom elements, and it doesn't help with anything that isn't specifically HTML (if you care about that sort of thing).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Alternatively, however, <em>we could define a single new foundational DOM method to expose <strong>any</strong> attribute this way</em></p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Can you show me?</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tYes!

They attempt to illustrate that there were ideas and forks of ideas along the way, each  considering different aspects of different problems; and that each had varying degrees of success.

All of this led helped shape the Web.</p>\n\n\t<p>It would be an understatement to say that early on, the vast majority of folks in the mature bits of the industry didn't really take the Web&nbsp;seriously yet. &nbsp;As explained in previous posts, the authors of mature hypertext products turned down early opportunities to integrate the Web outright. &nbsp;In 1992 Tim's&nbsp;talk proposal for&nbsp;the Hypertext Conference was actually rejected. &nbsp;Even in terms of new \"Internet ideas\" the Web didn't seem like the popular&nbsp;winner. SGML enthusiasts by and large shunned it as a crude interpretation of a much better idea with little hope of success. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)\" target=\"_blank\">Gopher</a>, which&nbsp;was created at almost exactly the same time, was gaining users far&nbsp;faster than this \"World Wide Web\". What did happen for the Web, however, is that a <em>huge percentage of the&nbsp;</em>small number of early enthusiasts involved started building browsers... Meanwhile,&nbsp;<em>existing ideas&nbsp;kept evolving independently</em>, and <em>new&nbsp;ideas started</em>&nbsp;emerging&nbsp;too and these would continue to help shape and inspire.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">1992-1993: &nbsp;WWWWI</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>1992 saw the birth of a <em>lot</em> of browsers and little actual hypertext. &nbsp;For perspective, by the end of 1992 there were&nbsp;<em>seven</em>&nbsp;web browsers which allowed users to surf the vast ocean of what was at the time <em>only 22 known Websites</em>. &nbsp;As each browser came online they built on Tim's original idea that the parser&nbsp;could just ignore tags it didn't understand and each attempted to \"adjust\" what we might call the political map of the Web's features. &nbsp;Each brought with it it's own ideas, innovations, bugs and so on. &nbsp;Effectively, this was the first \"Browser War\" or what I'll call \"World Wide Web War I\".</p>\n\n\t\t<p>There is one in particular, worth calling&nbsp;out: &nbsp;ViolaWWW. It was created by a student named Pei Wei and it included innovations like stylesheets, tables, inline images, a scripting language and even the ability to <em>embed</em> small applications. &nbsp;Remember that nearly all the popular non-Web, desktop hypertext and hypermedia products of the time had many these features. &nbsp;What made ViolaWWW different was that it was so much more than text. &nbsp;Viola (not ViolaWWW)&nbsp;was&nbsp;an Object Oriented programming language and a bytecode VM. &nbsp; The ViolaWWW&nbsp;browser was&nbsp;a just VM application (though, it was the killer one that made most people care about it) - this made it possible to do all sorts of incredibly interesting things.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"/media/viola-www-screenshots.png\" target=\"_blank\">viola.org\n\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Some&nbsp;people reading this in 2016 (or later) are likely simultaneously impressed and a perhaps just a little horrified by the idea that attempts to \"move away from\"&nbsp;nice clean declarative, semantic markup with scripts and programs came so early on. &nbsp;Tim must have been absolutely horrified, right?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Well, no that doesn't seem to be quite accurate - at least from what I read from the record. &nbsp;History is a&nbsp;lot more nuanced than we frequently tend to present it. &nbsp;Ideas are complex. &nbsp;Understanding nuances can be hard, but I'd like to try.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>As I described in Part II, Tim didn't imagine HTML would be \"<em>the</em> solution\" for content but rather</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote><em>I expected HTML to be the basic waft and weft of the Web but documents of all types: video, computer aided design, sound, animation and executable programs to be the colored threads that would contain much of the content. - Tim Berners-Lee in Weaving the Web</em></blockquote>\n\n\n\t\t<p>In fact, regarding Pei and Viola, he spoke in generally glowing terms in&nbsp;<em>Weaving the Web, </em>and numerous interviews. &nbsp;In his address at CERN in 1998, upon accepting a fellowship, he said</p>\n\n\n\t\t<blockquote>It's worth saying that I feel a little embarrassed accepting a fellowship when there are people like Pei Wei ...[who] read about the World Wide Web on a newsgroup somewhere and had some interesting software of his own; an interpreted language which could be moved across the NET and could talk to a screen.. in fact what he did was really ahead of his time.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>As questions came in related to similar ideas on the www-talk mailing list Tim&nbsp;answered and explained a number of related concepts. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1992/0065.html\" target=\"_blank\">Here's one that <em>might</em> capture his feelings at the time from May 1992</a>&nbsp;(Tim's is the reply):</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote><i>&gt; I would like to know, whether anybody has extended WWW such, that it is possible</i><i>&nbsp;to start arbitrary programs by hitting a button in a WWW browser.\n\t\t</i>\n\t\t<div style=\"margin-top: 1.5rem;\">Very good question. The problem is that of programming language. You need something really powerful, but at the same time ubiquitous. Remember a facet of the web is universal readership. There is no universal interptreted [sic] programming language. But there are some close tries. (lisp, sh). You also need something which can run in a very safe mode, to prevent virus attacks.... [It should be] public domain. A pre-compiled standard binary form would be cool too. &nbsp;It isn't here yet.</div></blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>While I don't know <em>precisely&nbsp;</em>what Tim was thinking in the early 1990's I do think it is worth&nbsp;noting the description, his the use of the words \"<em>cool\"&nbsp;</em> and \"<em>yet\"&nbsp;</em>as well as the absence of any sort of all caps/head exploding response. &nbsp;In fact, if you wade through the archives, it turns out that a lot of early talk and efforts in 1991-1992 were <em>already</em> specifically surrounding this weird line between documents and applications or HyperText and HyperMedia. &nbsp;Traditional desktop system makers had recognized the gap and early&nbsp;Web enthusiasts&nbsp;did too.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The point of this observation is simple:<em>&nbsp; \"We\" didn't really fully know what we were doing then, and in many ways we're still figuring it out today.</em>..&nbsp;and that's ok.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Even the inclusion of inline images brought new questions - MIME wasn't a given, content-negotiation was still kind of a rough dream and requests were very expensive.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Others were starting to add things like <code tag-esc=\"\">input</code> and annotation and comment systems and variable 'slots' into the markup for some rough idea of 'templating' to help flesh out the problem that a whole lot of a sites, even then, would have to be concerned with repeating things.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Some people wanted to make servers really smart. &nbsp;They saw the investment in a server as a thing which could query databases, convert document types on the fly, run business logic, etc. &nbsp;These folks thought that modifying HTML would give them something akin to the IBM 3270 model which allowed the pushing of values and the pulling of page-based responses. &nbsp;Others, like Pei, wanted to make clients smarter, or at least the cooperation between the two. &nbsp;At some level, these are conversations nearly as old as computing itself and we're still having them today.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Tim continues in that same post above to say that:</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>In reality, what we would be able to offer you real soon now with document format negotiation is the ability to return a document in some language for execution.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>Viola script by way of&nbsp;negotiation - which he explains would \"cover <em>most</em> Unix systems\". For Tim it seems (from my reading) that the <em>first</em> problem was that there wasn't a standard language, the <em>second</em> was that it might not be safe, the <em>third</em> was that if there was one it should be in the public domain. &nbsp;If you were on a Unix machine you'd be covered. &nbsp;If you had Viola, you'd be covered. &nbsp;If you had neither... well... it's complicated. &nbsp;But Viola had already begun tackling the safety issue too.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But even this early on - it&nbsp;didn't seem to be a question of&nbsp;<em>whether</em> applications should be part of the Web, but more like&nbsp;<em>how they should be. &nbsp;S</em>hould be&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>way or maybe a few?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>There was so much innovation and variance in browsers themselves that in December 1992 Tim sent an email entitled \"Let's keep the web together\" simultaneously praising the wealth of ideas and innovations and stressing that they should work to begin the process of future standardization/alignment lest the Web fragment too far.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">1993-1994: The Perfect Storm</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>When Marc Andreessen, was shown <em>Viola</em> it helped inspire him to start an&nbsp;effort at NSCA - at least that's one story.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>For all its value Viola had what turned out to be a critical flaw: &nbsp;It was hard to get it working. &nbsp;Despite all of its advantages, you had to install the runtime itself (the VM) and then run the browser in the runtime. Getting it setup and running proved problematic, even for a number of pretty technically savvy people. There were issues with permissions and bugs and Pei was kind of alone in building and maintaining it.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But this wasn't unique. &nbsp;Browsing the Web in 1993 was still a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;painful endeavor to get going. The line mode browser was placed into the public domain in May 1993. There wasn't a terribly lot there to browse either - even by the end of that year&nbsp;there were only&nbsp;130 known websites. Setup was difficult and things were generally very slow. &nbsp;Even finding something on that small number of sites was hard - forget searching Google, even Yahoo wasn't a thing yet. Even if you <em>could</em> get something working with one browser, chances were pretty decent that you might come across something where it wasn't the <em>right</em> browser for you to get the whole experience.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Marc Andreessen was the first one to start treating the browser like a modern product -&nbsp;really taking in feedback and smoothing out the bumps. &nbsp;The team at NCSA quickly ported his UNIX work to Mac and PC, there was even one for the Commodore Amiga. &nbsp;Mosaic was a good browser, but feature-wise, it probably wasn't even the&nbsp;<em>best</em>. &nbsp;Aside from ViolaWWW's notable work, some browsers already had pioneered forms, for example, and Mosaic initially didn't support forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;there was at least one thing they <em>nailed: &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They created&nbsp;an <em>easy to install and setup</em> browser on many platforms and drove the barrier to entry way down.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Moore's Law had finally created faster and cheaper machines <em>with modems</em> entering a more mainstream market; some notable regulation changes happened; when the makers of Gopher announced that&nbsp;<em>maybe just possibly in some circumstances you might be charged a very small fee</em> Tim convinced CERN to make a statement that the Web wouldn't do that.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>In other words:&nbsp;<em>When Mosaic was released publicly in late 1993 \"free for non-commercial use\" it was in the midst of the perfect storm.</em> &nbsp;Timing matters.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Suddenly the Web&nbsp;<em>really started</em> to hit and growth began to really explode. &nbsp;By 1994, there were an estimated 2800 sites. &nbsp;Regular People<sup>TM</sup> were being introduced to the Web for the first time and they were using Mosaic. &nbsp; After only&nbsp;roughly a year since&nbsp;being placed in the public domain, it is &nbsp;estimated that<em> less than 2% of Web users (still a comparatively small total by today's measures) were getting around&nbsp;using the line mode browser</em>. In April of that year, James Clark and Marc Andreessen established what would become Netscape.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Previous efforts to standardize didn't get there - It wasn't until November 28, 1994 that RFC-1886 was finally sent to the IETF to begin to create an HTML \"standard\" which we'll talk about in Part IV, but wouldn't ultimately arrive for another year and then in debatable form.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">The VM</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>Pei wasn't the only one thinking about a runtime VM, Sun Microsystems was too.&nbsp;&nbsp;As described in <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-2.html\">Part II</a>,&nbsp;Project Green spawned Oak thinking they'd found the next big market in consumer devices with embedded systems. &nbsp;By&nbsp;1992 they had a working demo for set-top boxes which created a read/write interactive internet-<em>like</em> experience for television - MovieWood which they had hoped to sell to cable companies. &nbsp;But the cable companies didn't bite.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>This confluence of timing and ideas left the Green Team at Sun wondering what to do with the rest of their&nbsp;lives and their ideas. &nbsp;Over the course of 3 days they discussed the success of Mosaic and decided their future.&nbsp; As James Gosling would later describe:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>Mosaic...&nbsp;revolutionized people's perceptions. The Internet was being transformed into exactly the network that we had been trying to convince the cable companies they ought to be building. All the stuff we had wanted to do, in generalities, fit perfectly with the way applications were written, delivered, and used on the Internet. It was just an incredible accident. And it was patently obvious that the Internet and Java were a match made in heaven.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t\t<p>So the Sun team went back to the drawing board to build a browser like Mosaic - but in Java (which was a lot like Pei's approach) and in 1994 they had a demo called \"WebRunner\", which would later be renamed \"HotJava<sup>TM</sup>. Within just a few months everyone, not just techies, were going crazy imagining the possibilities.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Nearly everyone seemed to think that this would change the world. As we'll see in Part IV, they might have been right, but not how they thought....</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t</section>\n\n\n",

Budgets and official policies were, as they are in many large organizations, pretty rigid and a little bureaucratic. &nbsp;CERN was about particle physics, not funding Tim's idea. &nbsp;More than that, many didn't recognize the value of lots of things which were actually necessary in some way.</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>The paradox of the Web was that this very very hard problem to connect heterogenous information from heterogeneous computers on heterogenous networks all over the word -- a very very hard problem, was solved by a small, non-official, open approach by a team with no resources, or, practically none. - Ben Segal from CERN who brought in TCP/IP 'under the radar'</blockquote>\n\n\n\t<p>In 1989, despite being actually&nbsp;<em>necessary </em>at this point&nbsp;for CERN to function, a memo went out reminding that it was \"unsupported\". &nbsp;A lot of the best things in history turn out to effectively have been people of good will working together outside the system to get things done that needed getting done.</p>\n\n\t<p>So, in September 1990 Mike Sendall, Tim Berners-Lee's boss at CERN&nbsp;found a  way to&nbsp;give&nbsp;Tim the approval to to develop his idea in a way that many good bosses through history tend to: While no one wanted to fund development of \"Tim's idea,\" there was some interest in Steve Jobs' new NeXT computer (which it appears was also brought in initially despite, rather than as part of CERN policy and plans). &nbsp;And so, under the guise of&nbsp;testing the capabilities/suitability of the NeXT computer for development at CERN in 1990 Tim&nbsp;would be able to create a prototype browser and server.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>The&nbsp;NeXT had great tools for developing GUI applications and Tim was able to build a pretty nice prototype GUI with read-write facilities pretty quickly. &nbsp;It let him figure out precisely&nbsp;<em>what</em> he was proposing.</p>\n\n\n\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left share-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t<img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"/media/tims-next-editor-bw.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\t\tA screenshot of the NeXT browser from 1993, courtesy of CERN - it looked very similar in 1991.\n\t</div>\n\n\t<p>As explained in <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">Part I of this history</a>, there was already a lot going on, standardized or in place by then - for example SGML. &nbsp;Because of this, CERN somewhat unsurprisingly, already had a bunch of SGML documents in the form of a thing called \"SGMLGuid\" (sometimes just GUID). &nbsp;Unfortunately, the earliest capture of this&nbsp;I can find is from 1992 but here's&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/History/1992/nfs_dxcern_mirror/rpc/doc/User/rpcuser.sgml\" target=\"_blank\">what SGMLGuid&nbsp;looked like</a>.</p>\n\n\t<p>SGML itself had gotten quite complex as it tackled ever more problems, and&nbsp;Tim&nbsp;didn't really <em>know</em> SGML. &nbsp;But he&nbsp;saw the clear value in having a language that was at least familiar l<em>ooking</em> for SGML authors, and of having some existing corpus of information. &nbsp;As he said later</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>Who would bother to install a client if there wasn't already exciting information on the Web? Getting out of this chicken and egg situation was the task before us....</blockquote>\n\n\t<p>Thus, he initially started with a kind of a subset of ~15 GUID tags (<em>plus the critical <code tag-esc=\"\">a</code>  tag for expressing hyperlinks&nbsp;which is Tim's own creation and at the very core&nbsp;of the idea - an exact number is hard to say because the earliest document on this isn't until 1992)</em>. &nbsp;As explained on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm\" target=\"_blank\">w3.org's origins</a> page:</p>\n\n\t<blockquote>The initial HTML parser ignored tags which it did not understand, and ignored attributes which it did not understand from the CERN-SGML tags. As a result, existing SGML documents could be made HTML documents by changing the filename from<em class=\"code\">xxx.sgml</em> to <em class=\"code\">xxx.html</em>. The earliest known HTML document is dated 3 December 1990:</blockquote>\n\n\t<code-format type=\"html\"><pre>&lt;p class=\"code\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Standardisation&lt;/h1&gt;\nThere was not a lot of discussion of this at &lt;a href=Introduction.html&gt;ECHT90&lt;/a&gt;, but there seem to be two leads:\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=People.html#newcombe&gt;Steve newcombe's&lt;/a&gt; and Goldfarber's \"Hytime\" committee\nlooking into SGML, and\n&lt;li&gt;An ISO working group known as MHEG, \"Multimedia/HyperText Expert Group\".\nled by one Francis Kretz (Thompsa SA? Rennes?).\n&lt;/lo&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre></code-format>\n\n\t<p>There's a lot of history hiding out in this first surviving HTML actually.</p>\n\n\t<p>First, note that this and many others weren't \"correct\" documents by many counts we'd think of today: There was no doctype, no <code tag-esc=\"\">html</code> element, no <code tag-esc=\"\">head</code>, <code tag-esc=\"\">title</code> or <code tag-esc=\"\">body</code> etc. &nbsp;There actually <em>wasn't</em> an HTML standard yet at that point so at some level it's kind of amazing how recognizable it remains today - not just to humans, but to browsers. &nbsp;Your browser will display that page <em>just fine.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;HTML, as it was being defined however, also wasn't valid <em>SGML </em>necessarily. &nbsp;The W3C site points out that the final closing tag is an error (it transposes the letters).</p>\n\n\n\t<p>More interestingly still for purposes here, I'd like to note that the very first surviving HTML document was about quite literally about Hyper<em>Media.&nbsp;</em>It's part of notes from what they called the hypertext conference and, unsurprisingly, that is what everyone was talking about. &nbsp;To understand why I think this matters, let's rewind just a little and tie in some things from&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">Part I</a>&nbsp;with some things that weren't....</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">The Tim<em>ing</em> of the Web</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Remember VideoWorks/Director from <a href=\"/blog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\">Part I</a>? &nbsp;It&nbsp;illustrated that perhaps&nbsp;the concept of Time was really important to&nbsp;hyper<em>media. &nbsp;</em>However,&nbsp;they weren't the only ones to see this.&nbsp;In fact, even as early as&nbsp;1984 people were already seeing a gap between <em>documents</em> and <em>hypermedia/multimedia</em> and talking about how to solve it. It&nbsp;turns out SGML, the reigning standard approach of the time for documents as markup actually wasn't quite suited to the task.&nbsp;It needed revision.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>So, Goldfarb (original GML creator, presumably mistyped above) went back to the drawing board with&nbsp;some more&nbsp;people to figure out how to apply it to a musical score. What they came up with was called SMDL (Standard Music Description Language), an&nbsp;effort that was ANSI&nbsp;approved in late 1985. &nbsp;However, no practical demonstration of SMDL was completed until 1990 and as part of a Master's thesis rather than a product (this dissonance over what makes a \"standard\" appears and reappears over and over in standards history).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's key though because&nbsp;you could definitely say that by the mid-late 80's,&nbsp;it was becoming obvious to many that the problem of time and linking objects in time was a more generalized problem. &nbsp;Video, for example, might have been a neat thing on the desktop but don't forget that in&nbsp;the 1980's, cable television was spreading along with computers and multimedia -- and much faster. By this time, a number of folks were beginning to imagine&nbsp;something like \"interactive TV\" as the potentially Next Really Big Thing (even before the Web). &nbsp;Sun Microsystems established a group, \"Green\" to figure out the next big thing, who&nbsp;thought it would be interactive consumer electronics (like interactive TVs).</p>\n\n\t\t<p>And so in 1989, just about the time Tim was putting together his ideas on the Web, the grander problem of Time/SGML was moved out of SMDL into a new ANSI project known as \"HyTime\" (Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language\" which had a lot of key players and support from major businesses.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It really looked like maybe it was going somewhere. &nbsp;Remember Ted Nelson from <a href=\"/bog/Brief-ish-History-of-The-Web-Part-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a>? &nbsp;In 1988, AutoDesk had decided to fund him directly and commercialize his ideas which had become known as Project Xanadu. An AutoDesk press release said:</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>In 1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product. And by 1995 it will begin to change the world.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>Nelson/Autodesk were some of the big names on that HyTime committee. &nbsp;Ironically, I think they got the years pretty close, but the technology wrong.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>At approximately the same time the MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) and&nbsp;MHEG (Multimedia and Hypertext Experts Group - also mentioned in that initial post above) were established. &nbsp;MHEG's focus, like a lot of other things included hypermedia&nbsp;documents, but unlike SGML required an MHEG <em>engine - </em>basically, a VM. &nbsp;The files they'd trade would be compiled binary rather than text-based. While they were authorable as documents, they were documents about interactive <em>objects</em>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>And so&nbsp;<em>this&nbsp;</em>is what people were talking about at the conference which Tim was summarizing in that early surviving HTML document. &nbsp;Both HyTime and MHEG were already thinking about how to standardize&nbsp;<em>this</em> quality in part because there is a lot of <em>media. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>An interesting thing about media is that people were building multimedia&nbsp;<em>applications.</em></p>\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Shipping</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>So the world around him was moving forward and there were lots of interesting ideas on all fronts. Tim had a prototype in hand. &nbsp;HTML as&nbsp;understood by the NeXT&nbsp;had no forms, no tables, you couldn't even nest things - it was flat. &nbsp;Not only did it have no&nbsp;CSS but no colors (his screen was black and white). &nbsp;But, for the most part&nbsp;many of his tags&nbsp;<em>were</em>&nbsp;simple formatting. &nbsp;You can debate that an H1 <em>is&nbsp;</em>semantic, but&nbsp;in Tim's interface it was under styling. &nbsp;That is, as you could \"style\" things as an H1, more or less WYSIWYG style, and the editor&nbsp;would flattened it all out in serializing&nbsp;markup.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Tim&nbsp;imagined (and has repeated since) that the most important thing was the URI, then HTTP then stuff like HTML and later CSS. &nbsp;URIs, in theory, can work for anything as long as you have a concept of a file that is addressable. &nbsp;HTTP was built with a feature called 'content type negotiation' which allows the sender to say what it's prepared to handle and the server to give him back something appropriate. &nbsp; As Tim explains this feature in&nbsp;<em>Weaving the Web:</em></p>\n\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>In general&nbsp;... the client and server have to agree on the format of data they both will understand. &nbsp;If they both knew WordPerfect for example, they would swap WordPerfect documents directly. &nbsp;If not, they could try to translate to HTML as a default.</blockquote>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>So the weird intricacies of HTML or things above weren't drastically important at the time because Tim didn't imagine HTML&nbsp;would be for everything. In fact, help address his chicken and egg problem described above, Tim just made his browser give URIs and auto-translate some popular existing protocols like NNTP, Gopher and WAIS to the HTML. &nbsp;But perhaps even this is over-simplifying just a bit - as he also explained:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>I expected HTML to be the basic waft and weft of the Web but documents of all types: video, computer aided design, sound, animation and executable programs to be the colored threads that would contain much of the content. &nbsp;It would&nbsp;<em>turn out</em> that HTML would become amazingly popular for the content as well...</blockquote>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">It would turn out...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>One of the most interesting things&nbsp;about invention is the stuff that the inventor&nbsp;<em>didn't&nbsp;</em>expect people would do with it. &nbsp;It would&nbsp;<em>turn out</em> that HTML would become really popular for content for a number of reasons. &nbsp;One reason, undoubtedly, is that the simplest thing to do is simply to provide HTML in the first place with no alternatives. &nbsp;More importantly, perhaps, &nbsp;to re-iterate the point from part I:&nbsp;The line between documents and 'more than documents' was clearly fuzzy.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>To illustrate:&nbsp;Even with the NeXT browser \"in hand\", it was very hard to show people value. Very few people had a NeXT, even at CERN - after all, it was a pilot&nbsp;for establishing whether the new-fangled machines&nbsp;would be useful. &nbsp;Lugging it around only went to far . &nbsp; There was a new project at CERN to provide a directory and&nbsp;Tim and early partners like Robert Cailliau&nbsp;convinced CERN to publish the directory via the Web.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left share-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"wp-image-1396 size-medium\" src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/251-2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n\t\t\t\tA screenshot of the Mac HyperCard address book application thanks to www.atarimagazines.com\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>This is interesting because address book applications were something that a lot of the <em>modern&nbsp;</em>computers of the time had, but a phonebook was a bunch of printed <em>pages</em>. &nbsp;Who wouldn't have liked that <em>application? &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It might have been potentially \"easy\" to create a nice HyperCard stack and auto-transform to HTML based on content type negotiation - but which part was document and which part was application? &nbsp;It was actually much easier to just deliver HTML which could be generated any number of ways - and with the current digital expectations of the day, on the machines they were using, that was just fine. &nbsp;Thus, the simple line mode browser that made the fewest assumptions possible was born as something that could be distributed to all the CERN machines (and all the world's machines - more on this below).</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The line mode browser was, frankly, boring. &nbsp;It was wildly inferior to the NeXT interface which was itself&nbsp;wildly inferior to something like OWL's Guide. &nbsp; &nbsp;But it worked, and as usual, that matters. &nbsp;Let me repeat that: &nbsp;<em>Shipping something useful matters.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>If you've never&nbsp;heard of Maslow's Hammer, you're probably at least familiar with the software version of it: &nbsp;We like to say \"If the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail\". &nbsp;Usually when we say it we're trying to say \"use the right tool for the job\". &nbsp;However, there's a corollary there that is just as true and often goes unnoticed: &nbsp;If someone only has a butter knife<em> it would turn out that they</em> can suddenly screw in some kinds of screws.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>It would also turn out that that's not entirely a bad thing: &nbsp;If you need to unclog something, a butter knife works. &nbsp;If you need a lever to lift something small in a tight spot, a butter knife works in a pinch. &nbsp;If you need a paperweight on a windy day, guess what turns out to work pretty well? Perhaps that wasn't the butter knife's original intent, but it is universally true. And guess what else turns out to be true? &nbsp;A butter knife and some other things were&nbsp;probably an \"almost\" approximation for some tool that didn't&nbsp;yet exist. &nbsp;What's more, having a few of those \"almost\" tools frequently&nbsp;helps&nbsp;inspire something better. &nbsp;Steven Johnson calls this \"the adjacent possible\" in his Ted Talk \"<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">Where good ideas come from</a>\" and I think it's as true of the Web as it is of anything.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Adjacent Possibles</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>However it came about, it turns out as well that the line mode browser was kind of perfect in time for a number of reasons. &nbsp;To keep things in perspective, this was 1990. &nbsp;While computers were starting to catch on, in 1990 they were still very expensive. &nbsp;As such, as deployed, many of them didn't even have OS' with something remotely like what we would call graphical UIs as a norm yet. &nbsp;Of those that did, few even had modems. &nbsp;And of those with modems, many still connected at 1200 or 2400 baud. &nbsp;We weren't connected nor even completely GUI yet. &nbsp;Those who&nbsp;<em>were</em> connecting most frequently were often doing so through large, expensive and frequently&nbsp;outdated systems which had been a <em>really&nbsp;</em>big investment years before.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Because of this, what the line mode browser <em>definitely did&nbsp;</em>was to allow Tim and others to show the people who&nbsp;<em>would </em>start&nbsp;writing the modern browsers with GUIs and increasingly recognizable features in short order and keep a small but steady stream of new potential enthusiasts checking it out. &nbsp;Sadly perhaps, another thing it did was to omit the&nbsp;<em>authoring</em> piece that was present on the NeXT machine and set in motion a trend where people perceived&nbsp;the Web as a way to&nbsp;<em>consume</em> rather than publish and contribute and likely spurned a greater focus on authoring HTML. &nbsp;\"Sadly Perhaps,\" but then again, perhaps that's precisely what was necessary in order for it to mature anyway. &nbsp;It's hard to say in retrospect.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>With a few new enthusiasts,&nbsp;in 1991 he created&nbsp;a mailing list:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/archives/WWW-TALK/www-talk-1991.index.html\" target=\"_blank\">www-talk</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;a while a very, <em>very</em> small but steadily growing group of people discussed the early \"Web\" they were trying to build. &nbsp;As more people came into the group&nbsp;they wanted more and different&nbsp;things - it should be more like HyTime, links should really work differently, it should actually be SGML rather than just \"inspired by\" or \"look like\" it and so on.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>What happened next just keeps getting more interesting.

So here it is, \"A Brief(ish) History of the Web Universe\" aka \"The Boring Posts\" in a few parts.  No themes, no punch, just history that I hope I can use to help explain where my own perspectives on a whole bunch of things draw from...</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Background</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>Businesses, knowledge, government and correspondence  were, for literally hundreds of years, built on paper documents.   How did we get from that world to this?  And how has that world, and our path, helped shape this one?  I'm particularly interested in the question of whether some of those implications are good or bad - what we can learn from the past in order to improve on our future or understand our present.  So how <em>did </em>we get here from there?</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Arguably the first important step was industrialization.  This changed the game in transforming the <em>size</em> of challenges and created new needs for efficiency.  This gave rise to the need for increasing agreement beginning with standards around physical manufacture - first locally, and then nationally around 1916.  World War II placed intense pressures and funded huge research budgets and international cooperation.  A whole lot of important things shook out in the 1940s and each developed kind of independently. I won't go into them much here except to note a few key points to help set the mental stage of what the world was like going into the story.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The word \"computer\" in anything resembling really modern terms wasn't even a thing until 1946.</p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left share-image\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/102618640-03-01.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\"> The First Digital Computer - ENIAC \"For a decade, until a 1955 lightning strike, ENIAC may have run more calculations than all mankind had done up to that point.\" from computerhistory.org\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>In 1947 ISO, the International Standards Organization, was founded.  That same year, the transistor was invented at Bell Labs.  In the late 1940's the Berlin Airlift transported over 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and supplies by developing a \"standard form\" document could be transmitted over just about any medium - including, for example, by telegraph.  Later this basic technique would become \"EDI\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Data Interchange</a>) and become the standard for commercial shipping and trade at scale, but It required very tight agreement and coordination on standard business documents and processes.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Transistors revolutionized things, but the silicone chips which really began the revolution weren't yet a thing.  Intel, who pioneered and popularized it wouldn't even be founded until 1968.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>During this interim few decades, the number of people <em>exposed to the idea of </em>computers began, very slowly to to expand - and that gets pretty interesting because we start to see some interesting forks in the road...</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">1960's Interchange, SGML and HyperStuff</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>In the mid 1960's Ted Nelson noted the flaw with the historical paper model:</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>Systems of paper have grave limitations for either organizing or presenting ideas. A book is never perfectly suited to the reader; one reader is bored, another confused by the same pages. No system of paper-- book or programmed text-- can adapt very far to the interests or needs of a particular reader or student.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>He imagined a very new possibility with computers, first in scholarly papers and then in books. He imagined this as an aid to authors as well which he explained evolve a work from random notes to outlines to advanced works.  He had a big vision.  In his description, he coined three important terms: Hypertext, Hypermedia (originally Hyperfilm) and Hyperlink.  For years, the terms Hypertext and Hypermedia would cause some problems. Some (including it seems to me Nelson) considered media as part of the text because it was serialized and others considered text as a subset of media) -- But this was all way ahead of its time. While it was going down, the price-point and capabilities just weren't really there. As he described in the same paper.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p1\">The costs are now down considerably. A small computer with mass memory and video-type display now costs $37,000;</p>\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>Another big aspect of his idea was unifying some underlying systems about files.  Early computers just didn't agree on anything.  There weren't standard chipsets much less standard file types, programs, protocols, etc.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Markup</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>In 1969, in this early world of incompatibility, three men at IBM (Goldfarb, Mosher and Lorie) worked on the idea of using markup documents to allow machines to trade and deal with a simple understanding of \"documents\" upon which they could specialize understanding, storage, retrieval or processing.  It was called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Generalized_Markup_Language\" target=\"_blank\">GML</a> after their initials, but later \"Generalized Markup Language\".  It wasn't especially efficient.  It had nothing to do with HyperAnything nor even EDI in a technical sense.  But it <em>was</em> comparatively easy to get enough rough agreement in order and flexible enough to make things actually work in order to achieve real things.  For example, you could send a GML document to a printer and define separately how precisely it would print.  Here's what it looked like:</p>\n\t\t\t<code-format type=\"css\"><pre>:h1.Chapter 1:  Introduction\n   :p.GML supported hierarchical containers, such as\n   :ol\n   :li.Ordered lists (like this one),\n   :li.Unordered lists, and\n   :li.Definition lists\n   :eol.\n   as well as simple structures.\n   :p.Markup minimization (later generalized and formalized in SGML),\n   allowed the end-tags to be omitted for the \"h1\" and \"p\" elements.</pre></code-format>\n\n   \t\t\t<p>But GML was actually a script - the tags indicated macros which could be implemented differently.  Over time, GML would inspire a lot, get pretty complicated, philosophical about declarative nature and eventually become SGML (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language\" target=\"_blank\">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a>).  This would continue growing in popularity - especially in the print industry.</p>\n   \t\t</section>\n   \t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n   \t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">The changing landscape</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>For the next decade, computers got faster, cheaper, and smaller and more popular in business, science and academia and these all matured and evolved on their own.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Networks were arising too and the need for standardization there seemed obvious.  For about 10 years there was an attempt to create a standard network stack in international committees, but it was cumbersome, complex and not really getting there.  Then, late in this process, Vint Cerf left the committee.  He led work focused on rough consensus and running code for the protocol and, in very short order, the basic Internet was born.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Around this same time, a hypertext system based on Nelson's ideas, called \"Guide\" was created at Carnegie Mellon University for Unix workstations.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Rise of the Computers</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>In the 1980's Macs and PCs, while still expensive, were finally becoming affordable enough that some regular people could hope to purchase them.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Return of the HyperStuff</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_(hypertext)\" target=\"_blank\">Guide</a> was commercially sold by, ported by to the Mac and PC by, and later <em>very much improved</em> on by a company called OWL (Office Workstations Limited) led by a man named Ian Ritchie.  It introduced one of the first real hypertext systems to desktops in 1985.  In 1986 Guide won a British Computer Society award. Remember \"Guide\" and \"Ian Ritchie\" because they're going to come back up.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\" size-full wp-image-1340 alignleft\" src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hcard1-1.png\" alt=\"\">Another two years later people were really starting to take notice of \"HyperText\" (and beginning to get a little over-generalized with the term - frequently this was really becoming \"HyperMedia\").  In 1987, an application called \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMFscTOazS0\">HyperCard</a>\" was introduced and the authors convinced Apple to give it away free for all Mac users.  It was kind of a game changer.\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>HyperCard was a lot like Guide in many ways but with a few important details we'll come back to.  The world of HyperCards was built of \"decks\" - each deck a stack of \"cards\" full of GUI: forms, animations, information and interactions which could be linked together and scripted to do all sorts of useful things.  Cards had an innate \"order\" and could link to and play other media which would - the state of things in a card/deck was achieved through scripting.  They were bitmap based in presentation and cleverly scalable.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<hr style=\"visibility: hidden\">\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-right\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"\" src=\"http://www.fentonia.com/bio/mmdir.gif\" alt=\"\"> Screenshot of VideoWorks and the \"score\"\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>That same year, in 1987, a product called VideoWorks by a company named Macromind was released.  In fact, if you got a Mac, you saw it because it was used to create the interactive guided tour that shipped with it.   You could purchase it for your own authorship.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>One interesting aspect of VideoWorks was its emphasis on time.  Time is kind of an important quality of non-static <em>media</em>, so if you're interested in the superset of hypermedia, you need the concept of time.  Thus, the makers of VideoWorks included a timeline upon which things were 'scored'.  With this HyperMedia, authors could allow a user to move back and forth in the score at will.  This was kind of slick, it made sense to a lot of people and it caught on.  Their product later became \"Director\" and it became a staple for producing high-end, wow'ing multimedia content on the desktop, CD-ROMs for kiosks and so on.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>By the late 1980's, OWL's Guide had really come to focus on the PC version.  Hypercard was Free on the Mac and as it's creator Ian Ritchie would say later...</p>\n\n\t\t\t<blockquote>You can compete on a lot of things, but it's hard to compete with free...</blockquote>\n\n\n\t\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">The emergence of an increasingly fuzzy line...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t\t<p>Note that most of these existing systems of this time actually dealt, in a way, with hyper<em>media </em>in the sense that they didn't draw so closely to this fundamental primitive idea based on paper.  <em>All of these could be scripted and and you might imagine: Applications were a natural outcropping.   </em>The smash game Myst was actually just a really nice and super advanced HyperCard stack!\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">The Stage is Set...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>The Internet was there.  It was available - in use even, but it was pretty basic and kind of cumbersome.  Many people who used the internet perhaps didn't even realize what the internet really was - they were doing so through an online service like Compuserve or Prodigy.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>But once again, as new doors were opened, some saw new promise.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"4\" style=\"font-size: 2.75rem;\">The Early 1990s</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>I've already mentioned that SGML had really nothing at first to do with HyperMedia, but here's where it comes back in.  The mindset around HyperCard was stacks and cards.  The mindset around VideoWorks/Director was Video.  The mindset of OWL was documents.  SGML was a mature thing and having something to do with SGML was kind of a business advantage.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><em>Guide had SGML-based documents</em>.  More than that, it called these \"Hypertext Documents\" and their SGML definition was called \"HyperText Markup Language\" (which they abbreviated HML) and it could deliver them <em>over networks</em>.  Wow.  Just WOW, right?  Have you even <em>heard</em> the term \"Web\" yet?  No.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>But wait - there's more!  Looking at what else was going on, OWL had much advanced Guide on the PC and by now it had integrated sound and video and advanced scripting ability too.  While it was \"based\" on documents, it was so much more.  What's more, while all of this was possible, it was hidden from the <em>average</em> author - it had a really nice GUI that allowed both creation and use. That it was SGML underneath was, to many, a minor point or even a mystery.</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">Web Conception</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p><em>This</em> is the world into which HTML was conceived.  I say conceived rather than \"born\" or \"built\" because Tim had been working out his idea for a few years and refining it.  He talked about it to anyone who would listen about a global, decentralized, read-write system that would really change the Internet.  He had worked out the idea of an identifier, a markup language and a protocol but that was about it.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><em>And here's the really interesting bit:  He didn't really want to develop it, he wanted someone else to.</em>  As Tim has explained it several times...</p>\n\n\t\t<p></p><blockquote>There were several commercial hypertext editors and I thought we could just add some internet code, so that the hypertext documents could then be sent over the internet. I thought the companies engaged in the then fringe field of hypertext would immediately grasp the possibilities of the web.</blockquote><p></p>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-22-at-1-18-55-pm.png?w=300\" alt=\"\">Screenshot of OWL's Guide in 1990\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>Remember OWL and Guide? Tim thought they would be the perfect vehicle, they were his first choice.  So, in November 1990, when Ian Ritchie took to a trade show in Versaille to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noOrW6u-JF4\" target=\"_blank\">show off Guide's HyperMedia</a>, Tim approached him and tried hard to convince him to make OWL the browser of the Web.  However, as Tim notes <em>\"Unfortunately, their reaction was quite the opposite...\"  </em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>Note that nearly all of the applications discussed thus far, including OWL, were commercial endeavors.  In 1986, authors who wanted to use OWL to publish bought a license for about $500 and then viewers licensed readers for about $100.  To keep this in perspective, in adjusted dollars this is roughly $1,063 for writers and $204 for readers.  This is just how software was done, but it's kind of different from the open source ethos of the Internet.  A lot of people initially assumed that making browsers would be a profitable endeavor.  In fact, later Mark Andreeson <em>would</em> make a fortune on the name Netscape in part because there was an assumption that people would buy it.  It was, after all, a killer app.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>It's pretty interesting to imagine where we would be now if Ritchie had been able to see it.  What would it have been like with OWL's capabilities as a <em>starting point, </em>and what impact the commercial nature of the product might have had on the Web's history and ability to catch on.   Hard to say.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>However, with this rejection (and other's like it) , Tim realized</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>...it seemed that explaining the vision of the web was exceedingly difficult without a web browser in hand, people had to be able to grasp the web in full, which meant imagining a whole world populated with websites and browsers. It was a lot to ask.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>He was going to have to build something in order to convince people.  Indeed, Ian Ritchie would later give a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_ritchie_the_day_i_turned_down_tim_berners_lee?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Talk </a>about this in which he admits that two years later when he saw Mosaic he realized \"yep, that's it\" - he'd missed it.</p>\n\t</section>\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">A Final Sidebar...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image p-attached p-attached-left\" style=\"margin-top:0\">\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://briankardell.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hqdefault-1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\"> PenPoint Tablet in 1991\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>At very nearly the same time something that was neither HyperStuff nor SGML nor Internet related entered the picture.

I was employee #2 of this new effort and we worked in an attic loft. Nearly all of my experience before this was from books and pure experimentation/willpower to accomplish something. I worked there for about a year, mostly by myself churning out code in somewhat typical fashion: Someone said ‚Äúmake it look like this picture‚Äù or ‚Äúthis stuff needs to come from a database‚Äù and that was pretty much it. I worked too hard, I was usually scared to death I'd never be able to figure out that one new technology that each project introduced me to and quite often it was just struggle to finish and make something work.</p>\n\n\t<p>I was learning a lot about APIs and the languages I was working with, but very little about how to do my job. If this sounds confusing to you, you're not alone: I've been writing software professionally for about 20 years and I've worked on a lot of teams with a wide array of people and initially nearly all of them hold the position that that is my whole job. So, let me explain the counterpoint and how I came to hold this idea about what my job really is.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">My First Lesson...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>About a year into my first job, an opportunity came up for a project that the boss didn't want to pass up: A former client with a startup who had gotten into some trouble with a deadline had heard we were doing this sort of thing now. Success would likely mean more work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut it was considerably over our heads. It dealt with some ideas for which there were only two books we could find and it seemed at the time like pretty high-end nerd stuff. We'd be working with the author of those books directly. The deadlines looked clearly impossible even if it were something we'd understood well. Still, the boss signed the contract on faith and almost immediately we lost the only other employee we had‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit was just me.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So the boss negotiated with an old partner who had left the company to come back and help out. His name was George and, actually, he was the one that recommended me for the position in the first place. He was friendly and quiet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa lanky guy with beard and glasses, a seasoned engineer who was great with C but he knew nothing about the Web. He came back on one condition: He was running the team‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääno questions or pressure or status inquiries from the boss. It seemed strange to me coming from this quiet and very amiable guy.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>On the first day, we had a meeting. I brought a thick printout of 4 .asp pages‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeach tens of thousands of lines of vbscript that represented 4 pages in their application that they had nearly completed. They said ‚Äúuse these as a guide and do these other 6 pages in the next 2 months‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe'll do the rest‚Äù. They had a virtual army of people banging away on keyboards because in 2 months they had to ship something like 40 ‚Äúpages‚Äù (their application) and in the past 3 months they had completed just the 4.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go over these and I can explain what I've already figured out‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>‚ÄúNo, tell me how a Web page works‚Äù he replied. I gave some quick explanation of HTML documents and elements and tried to move on.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><em>‚ÄúNo, but tell me how it works.‚Äù</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>After much back and forth for a couple of hours I said ‚Äúok, are you ready to get started?‚Äù He cocked his head to the side, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? We are started.‚Äù</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Literally all day long we drew diagrams on the board and discussed urls, query strings, HTTP methods, their relation to pages and state and HTML elements, frames, JavaScript, .asp and on and on.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>That night I didn‚Äôt sleep. I pondered over those printouts, I made notes. I edited code and tested my understanding of it (usually to ill effect). I did math involving the number of people typing, the lines of code, the work cut out for us and how much it cost us to have lost an entire day talking.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>The next day I felt a little better: All I needed was some progress then surely I‚Äôd settle down. But that day too, we talked‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe talked about OLAP and SQL and COM and how you'd use them with .asp and IIS and HTTP. How the server was communicating and what we painting on the screen. Where was the state and so on. Every so often the boss would peek in and look worried and George would quickly dismiss him.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>On day 4 I had something of a meltdown: ‚Äú<em>This is killing my career</em>,‚Äù I thought. I confronted him ‚ÄúGeorge, I don't know what‚Äôs going on here. Maybe you can afford to do this, but I have to pay my rent‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI work here day in and day out. That guy pays my salary and this contract will pay us both and give us more work. We've nothing to show and we're closing in on a significant fraction of the time we have which was already too short. By the end of next week, we have to have one of these done. The boss wants to see progress. The client wants to see progress. My job is to write this code, not to help you feel like you're learning or have interesting conversations. I don't know what happened between the two of you, but you need to get past it‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI can't let some power trip or revenge take me down like this.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>George was quiet. </p>\n\n\t\t<p>He took a deep breath through his nose and looked thoughtful about my comments. He reached out to the table and slowly opened a box of chocolate covered cherries that was sitting there, unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth and shook his head. He didn't look angry. He didn't look frustrated or guilty. Instead, he looked more the way a grandfather might look just before he passed down some sage wisdom‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust trying to figure out how to explain. I‚Äôll try to summarize some of the wisest words that ultimately came...</p>\n\n\n\t\t<blockquote><p>Any monkey can write code, it doesn't always turn out well. Why do you think I am here? I‚Äôm not the only engineer in town‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou have others right here. Your boss is a skilled engineer and just next door you could get two guys at half the price. I'll tell you why: I'm here because this project is in trouble. Coding as fast as you can won‚Äôt work, and your boss knows that I won‚Äôt do that. </p>\n\t\t<p>Imagine that we did. Even if we didn't encounter problem after problem with code we didn't fully understand‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääworking 15 hours a day odds are still about 99% that we'd fail. Who would that serve? We'd be battered and broken‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot us. Would it make your boss happy that you came up short? Not likely. Would it make his client happy that he failed to ship? Would you get follow-on work? Not a chance.</p>\n\t\t<p>That‚Äôs our job Brian‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsuccessfully shipping something that actually meets their needs. It involves programming‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähopefully good programming‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut the programming and the lines of code isn't what the client wants, it‚Äôs the end result. They have to ship. This is make or break for them. You think I'm somehow not taking it seriously but I am: I want them to succeed, that‚Äôs all I want. That‚Äôs what your boss understands, and why he had the faith to bring me on. So I'm asking you to trust me‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe're going to get this done and give them what they really want‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe thing they really need to be done. Trust me, the rest will take care of itself.</p></blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>Over the course of the next 2 weeks it was slow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe completed one page. It was a tiny fraction of the amount of code it had taken them. It seemed like a minor win, but I was still full of dread: We were behind. It took a week and a half to complete the next one, a lot of that was readjusting some earlier assumptions that turned out to be wrong, but the code actually got smaller. The last 4 fell like dominoes in just a few days and we were done‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääearly. Each one was really easy to craft and hardly took any code at all.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>When we synced up with the main team they confessed that they were way behind. They were impressed‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädespite having all of those people they'd completed only 10 and they were more than a little worried about their quality. Could we do a few more? In the end, in fact, the lion‚Äôs share of the total work was done by our team (mostly George too because as it turned out, I had planned a vacation thinking we were done) in an amazingly short time.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Everyone was happy. I learned an incredible amount of engineering which has continued to help me throughout the years. George was a great teacher. But the real value I took away was much bigger and more abstract than this.</p>\n\n\t\t<p><em>The end goal is to help the client be successful.</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>George wasn't religiously following engineering practices because some study had shown that over time it would lower maintenance cost or something abstract. Of course, he employed good principles which helped with that, but‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe wanted to ship. That‚Äôs what everyone wanted. He was simply using whatever powers he had at his disposal to solve the right problems rather than the wrong ones.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I, my boss, and even the client mistakenly understood the problem to be ‚Äúhow do we measure and knock down units of work to do variants of what someone clumsily hacked together before they really understood the problem‚Äù . George was able to see the greater issue. Originally, their product shipped on time with two completely different approaches inside‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat‚Äôs not great engineering, in fact, it‚Äôs terrible. George never tried to tell them they should do otherwise‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe simply showed them a better way, he delivered and optimized everyone‚Äôs happiness. If they had any sense, they went back and learned the right lessons.</p>\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">On my own...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t\t<p>Over the years I've frequently been in situations where I've had to apply these lessons. It‚Äôs not always easy and sometimes the hardest part is the fact that under a lot of pressure, no one can see the forest for the trees. No one wants to hear you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can frequently be misunderstood as shooting for unaffordable perfection or just ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù even if that is pretty clearly not the case. But let me share just one of many stories about how this matters in a very real way‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand why it‚Äôs worth caring and having the integrity to focus on the non-programming bits.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Several years ago I was contracted by a large company for 6 months to complete a simple task: They had a number of systems which were written in Java or .NET. After years of discussion and planning they had timetables and budgets and a directive to convert all of their existing .NET applications to Java. I was hired to do one. They practiced a waterfall methodology and had already spent tons in codifying the requirements and analysis of the existing system and so on. More or less a straight port. They wanted me to potentially suggest a few minor UI tweaks since I was pretty good with JavaScript and CSS, but otherwise straightforward. I spent my first two weeks reading requirements, looking at code, trying to get set up and run through the existing system and so on. At the end of all of this, I had a nagging problem: I still had no idea what this system was actually for and I couldn't even get it to do simple things without crashing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven the one in production.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>At beginning of the third week I was really torn. I just didn't feel like I understood the problem. I could very easily ‚Äúport‚Äù the NET code to Java more or less class for class, but how could I be sure I was doing it right‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow could I test it? How could I suggest UI enhancements if I didn't understand what I was enhancing? I honestly couldn't afford to lose this job by pissing someone off, I'd just bought a house and my car died‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthings were going badly and I was stretched far beyond my limits. Part of me wanted to come to work, do the conversion and take the paycheck and hope. The other part of me won that day though as I remembered George‚Äôs words and I walked into my boss‚Äô office and asked him for a moment of his time. I explained all this and asked if perhaps he could point me to some actual users of the system who could just let me observe how they used it for an hour or so so that I could actually understand the job I was trying to accomplish‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot the programming, the actual thing the program was supposed to do: The intent. After a while, to his credit, he agreed and he sent a few of us, not just me.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Afterward, we met again to compare notes and, without fail the experience was universal: They don‚Äôt use it.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><em>Wait...What?</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><em>Why?</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>It‚Äôs pretty simple actually: It doesn't work for what it is designed for‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it wasn't designed to do what they actually need. So instead, they do all these other crazy things with other systems‚Ä¶ They each do it their own way‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut they're all just solving the same problems on their own.

It‚Äôs that same quality of solving problems that occasionally gives you an insight that others can‚Äôt have. What someone is asking you for is frequently abstract, it often lacks an understanding of the medium and that means various choices incur significantly more cost than others. It‚Äôs quite possible (at least in my experience) that with just a little cooperation and effort you can adjust expectations, correct problems with deadlines and budgets and just generally increase the overall happiness of everyone.

            "summary": "Very early in my career, I was lucky enough to stumble on Web development before it really became a ‚Äúthing‚Äù and landed an apprenticeship (and later job) in a new, small experimental arm of an established consulting firm which primarily worked on embedded systems. I was employee #2 of this new effort and we worked in an attic loft. Nearly all of my experience before this was from books and pure experimentation/willpower to accomplish something. I worked there for about a year, mostly by myself churning out code in somewhat typical fashion: Someone said ‚Äúmake it look like this picture‚Äù or ‚Äúthis stuff needs to come from a database‚Äù and that was pretty much it. I worked too hard, I was usually scared to death I'd never be able to figure out that one new technology that each project introduced me to and quite often it was just struggle to finish and make something work.",

You know everything that's wrong, so fix it.&nbsp;- Linda Lee's character to Bruce in \"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story\" (a fictional, but inspiring scene)\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>Ok, so we all agree that standards are painful to develop and have sometimes gone very wrong. &nbsp;From the outside they look, at times, almost comically inefficient, illogical or even self-defeating. &nbsp;Many comments in our panel were about this in some form: &nbsp;<em>Too much classical mess - too much Wing Chun</em>.</p>\n\n\t\t<p style=\"clear: left\">Bruce Lee saw through the strict rules of forms to what they were trying to accomplish, and he said \"yeah, but that&nbsp;could be better- what about this instead\"... and&nbsp;opponents fell.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Likewise, standards bodies and processes are not a religion. &nbsp;Sometimes process is just process - it can be in the way, unproductive - even&nbsp;harmful if it isn't serving its true&nbsp;purpose. &nbsp;There are no&nbsp;holy texts (including the Manifesto itself) and there should be no blind faith in them: &nbsp;We are thinking, rational people. &nbsp;The Manifesto lays out guiding principles, with what we hope is a well rationed incentive, not absolutes. &nbsp;<em>Ideological absolutes suck, if you ask me, and Bruce's approach makes me think he'd agree.</em></p>\n\n\t\t<p>The Manifesto is pretty short though, it begs follow-on and one recurrent theme was that many people at the conference seemed interested in discussing what they perceived to be contradiction in that we have not redirected absolutely everything toward the absolute lowest primitives possible (and for others, a fear that we would). &nbsp;I'd like to explain my own perspective:</p>\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">It is often more important to ask the question than it is to answer it perfectly.</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/bruce-lee-goal-not-always-meant-to-be-reached.jpeg\" alt=\"A Goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at - Bruce Lee\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Again, the Manifesto&nbsp;lays&nbsp;out <em>principles to strive for, not laws</em>:&nbsp;Avoid large, deep sinks of high-level decisions which involve many new abstractions and eliminate the possibility of competition&nbsp;and innovation - we have finite resources and this is not a good use of them.&nbsp;Favor lower level APIs&nbsp;that <em>allow</em> these things to occur instead - they will, and try to help explain existing features. &nbsp;<em>Where to draw the line between pragmatism and perfection is debatable, and that's ok - we don't have to have all of the perfect answers right now, and that's good, because we don't.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-right\">\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/bruce-lee-too-much-time-thinking.png\" alt=\"If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done - Bruce Lee\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>Paralysis is bad. &nbsp;Perfect, as they say, can be&nbsp;the enemy of good: &nbsp;Progress matters and 'perfect' is actually a non-option because it's an optimization problem that involves many things, including an ever changing environment. &nbsp;Realize that&nbsp;there are many kinds of advantage that have historically trumped theoretical purity<em> every time</em>&nbsp;- the technically best answer has never, to the best of my knowledge 'won' - and shipping <em>something</em> is definitely way up there in terms of things you need to succeed. More importantly, do what we can to avoid bad.&nbsp;At some <em>very basic&nbsp;</em>level, all the Manifesto is really saying is: &nbsp;\"Hey standards bodies -- Let's find ways to manage risk and complexity, to work efficiently and use data for the really big choices\".</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>In my mind, the W3C TAG has done a great job of attempting to redirect spec authors, <em>without paralyzing progress,&nbsp;</em>toward asking the right questions: \"Is this at an <em>appropriately</em> low level?\", \"If it isn't quite at the bottom, <em>does it look like we can get there from here</em> - or is it what's here too high-level and overly complicated with magic to be explained?\", \"Can we explain existing magic with this?\" and, \"Is it consistent in the platform so that authors can re-apply common lessons and reasoning\"?</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>I'm sure the there are some who would disagree, but in the end, I think that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html\" target=\"_blank\">Web Audio API</a>&nbsp;is a nice&nbsp;example of this kind of pragmatism at play. &nbsp;There are things that we know already: &nbsp;We've have an <code tag-esc=\"\">audio</code> tag, for example, for a while. We have&nbsp;a collected&nbsp;cases which should be plausible, but currently aren't. &nbsp;The Web Audio API tries to address this at a considerably lower level, but <em>definitely</em> not the lowest one possible. &nbsp;<em>However...&nbsp;</em>It has been purposely planned and reviewed to make sure that it gives good answers to the above questions. &nbsp;While it's possible that this could lead to something unexpected beneath, we've done a lot to mitigate that risk and admitted that we don't have all of the information we need to make good choices there yet. &nbsp;It was built with the idea that it will have further low-level fleshing out and that we think we know enough about it to say that we can use it to explain the mechanics of the audio tag with it. &nbsp;We got the initial spec and now, nearly immediately, they've begun work on the next&nbsp;steps. &nbsp;This has the advantage of steady progress, drawing a boundary around the problem and gives a lot of developers new tools with which they'll help ask the right questions and through use, imagine new use cases which feed into a better process. &nbsp;It gives us tools that we need so that efforts&nbsp;like <a href=\"https://github.com/dglazkov/html-as-custom-elements\" target=\"_blank\">HTML as Custom Elements</a>&nbsp;can begin to contribute in helping to explain the higher level feature. &nbsp;The real danger is only in stopping the progressive work.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Similarly, it was asked&nbsp;by someone whether&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/beacon/#sec-sendBeacon-method\" target=\"_blank\">Beacon</a><em>&nbsp;\"</em>flies in the face of the Extensible Web Manifesto\" because it could be described by still further low level primitives (it might be possible to implement with Service Workers, for example). &nbsp;Again, I'd like to argue that in fact, it doesn't. &nbsp;It's always been <em>plausible</em>, but prohibitively cumbersome to achieve roughly the same effect - this is why <a href=\"https://developers.whatwg.org/links.html#ping\" target=\"_blank\">HTML added a declarative&nbsp;<code>ping</code> attribute to links</a>: &nbsp;Simple use cases should be simple and declarative - the problem isn't that high-level, declarative things&nbsp;exist, we <em>want those - </em>the Manifesto is explicit about this --&nbsp;the problem is in how we go about identifying them. &nbsp;Because this is a really common case that's been around for a long time - we already <em>have</em> a lot of good data on that. &nbsp;As it happens, ping wasn't implemented by some browsers, but they were interested in sendBeacon, which - hooray - can actually be used to describe what ping does, and maybe polyfill it too! &nbsp;It's simple, constrained, concise - and it's getting implemented. &nbsp;It's enough for new experimentation and it's also different enough from what you typically do with other network level APIs that maybe it's fine that it have no further explanation. &nbsp;If you read my posts, you know that I like to make the analogy of evolution, and so I'll point to something similar in the natural world: &nbsp;This may simply be a case of convergent evolution - differently adapted&nbsp;DNA that has a similar-looking effect, but share none of the primitives you might think, and that too can actually be ok.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<p>The important part isn't that we achieve perfection as much as that we ask the questions, avoid bad mistakes and make good progress that we can iterate on: <em>Everyone actually shipping something that serves real needs and isn't actively bad is actually a killer feature.</em></p>\n\t\t</section>\n\n\n\t\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"3\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem;\">The Non-Option</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"captioned-image optional p-attached p-attached-left\">\n\t\t\t\t<img data-src=\"/media/bruce-lee-defeat-state-of-mind.jpg\" alt=\"Defeat is a state of mind; no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality - Bruce Lee\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Bruce had a lot excellent quotes about the pitfalls of aiming too low or defeating yourself.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p style=\"clear:right\">It's easy to look at the very hard challenges ahead of us to distill the cumbersome sky-castles we've built into sensible layers and fundamentals and just say \"too hard\" or \"we can't because explaining it locks out our ability to improve performance\".</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Simultaneously, one of the most urgent needs is that we fill the gaps - if the Web lacks features that exist in native, we're losing.

In it, he concludes \"<em>the misery exists because of the W3C‚Äîthe World Wide Web Consortium... So, respectfully, but quite seriously, I suggest: let‚Äôs Disband the W3C</em>\". Ultimately he suggests that \".<em>..the alternative is a web that‚Äôs organized entirely as a set of open-source software projects.</em></p>\n\n\t<p style=\"font-weight: bolder;\">In his recent talk/post, Matthew Butterick raises several points:</p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><span style=\"font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\">It takes a really long time for standards to reach Recommendation Status (\"the Web is 20 years old)</span></li>\n\t\t<li>The W3C doesn't enforce standards</li>\n\t\t<li>Browser vendors eventually implement the same standards differently</li>\n\t\t<li>We fill pages with hacks and black magic to make it work</li>\n\t\t<li>Ultimately, what we wind up with still isn't nearly good enough</li>\n\t\t<li>There is no good revenue model</li>\n\t\t<li>Newspaper and magazine sites all look roughly the same and are somewhat 'low design'.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\n\t<p>His presentation is definitely interesting and worth a read/view.

The post is short enough and already bulleted so I won't summarize here, instead I encourage you to go have a read yourself. &nbsp;He&nbsp;closes up with the point that \"Nowhere in Matthew Butterick‚Äôs talk is there a&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;proposal for how we could get agreements any quicker or easier or less painfully than we do now by following the current standards-development process.\" (emphasis mine).</span>\n\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Indeed, the open source projects mentioned by Butterick are about as much like standards as a raven is like a writing desk and, in my opinion, to replace a standards body with a vague \"bunch of open source projects\" would send us down a nasty rabbit hole (or through the looking glass) into a confusing and disorienting world: Curiouser and curiouser.</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"alice\">‚ÄúWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\"<br>\n\"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.\"<br>\n\"I don't much care where ‚Äì\"<br>\n\"Then it doesn't matter which way you go.‚Äù\n<div>‚Äï&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8164.Lewis_Carroll\">Lewis Carroll</a>,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2933712\">Alice in Wonderland</a></em></div>\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>Still, I don't think Butterick really means it quite so literally. &nbsp;After all, &nbsp;he&nbsp;holds up PDF as an ISO standard that \"just works\" and ISO is anything but an open source project 'like Wordpress'. &nbsp;In fact, PDF and ISO could have some of the same challenges laid against them.

ISO is a non-governmental organization and it has no power to enforce the implementation of the standards it develops.\n\t\t</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>It seems to me that ISO and W3C have a whole lot more in common than they differ IMO: &nbsp;Standards are proposed by stakeholders, they go before technical committees, they have mailing lists and working groups, they have to reach&nbsp;consensus, etc. &nbsp;Most of this is stated in Michael's post. &nbsp;Additionally though, all PDF readers are not alike either: Different readers have different level of support for reflow and there is a separate thing called \"PDF/A\" which extends the standard (they aren't the only ones) and adds DRM (make it expensive?).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some readers/authors can accept links to places outside the file, some can't. &nbsp;Some can contain comments added by reviewers or markings, others can't. &nbsp; Etc.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">You used to be much more...\"muchier.\"</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>I think that instead, Butterick is simply (over) expressing his frustration and loss of hope in the W3C: &nbsp;\"They've lost their \"muchness\". &nbsp;You know what? &nbsp;It&nbsp;<em>really does <strong>suck</strong> that we have experienced all of this pain, a</em>nd to be honest, Butterick's technical examples aren't even scratching the surface. &nbsp;After 20 years, you really really think we'd be a little further along.</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"alice\">‚ÄúI can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.‚Äù\n<div>‚Äï&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8164.Lewis_Carroll\">Lewis Carroll</a>,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2933712\">Alice in Wonderland</a></em></div></blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>A lot of the pain we've experienced has taken place due to really big detour in the history of Internet standards: The ones we really use and care about were basically sort of put on hold and efforts mostly put toward a \"something else\". &nbsp;Precisely which something else would have made the Web super awesome is a little fuzzy, but whatever it was you could bet that it would have contained at least one of the letters \"x\" \"m\" or \"l\" and have contained lots of \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\"'s. &nbsp;The browser maker with the largest market share disbanded their team and another major one split up. &nbsp;It got so contentious at one point that the WHATWG was established to carry on the specs that the W3C were abandoning.</p>\n\t</section>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Re-muchifying...</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>While we can't go back and fix that now, the question is: &nbsp;Can we prevent the problems from happening again and work together to make the Web a better place? &nbsp;I think we can.</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"alice\">‚ÄúWhy, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.‚Äù\n<div>‚Äï&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8164.Lewis_Carroll\">Lewis Carroll</a>,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2933712\">Alice in Wonderland</a></em></div></blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>The W3C is an established standards body with a great infrastructure and all of the members you'd really need to make something happen. &nbsp;Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich had <a href=\"http://brendaneich.com/2004/06/the-non-world-non-wide-non-web/\" target=\"_blank\">some good advice in 2004</a>:</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote>What matters to web content authors is user agent market share. The way to crack that nut is not to encourage a few government and big company ‚Äúeasy marks‚Äù to go off on a new&nbsp;<em>de-jure</em>&nbsp;standards bender. That will only add to the mix of formats hiding behind firewalls and threatening to leak onto the Internet.</blockquote>\n\n\t\t<p>More has happened to drive Web standards and browser development/interoperability forward in the past 2-3 years than happened in the 6-7 years combined and more is queued up than I can even wrap my head around. &nbsp;We have lots of new powers in HTML and lots of new APIs in the DOM and CSS. &nbsp;We have efforts like <a href=\"http://testthewebforward.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Test the Web Forward</a>&nbsp;uncovering problems with interoperability and nearly all browsers becoming&nbsp;<em>evergreen</em> - pushing out improvements and fixes all the time. &nbsp;We also managed to get some great reformers elected to the W3C Technical Architecture Group recently who are presenting some great ideas and partnership and cooperation between W3C and other standards bodies like ECMA/TC-39 (also making excellent progress) are beginning. &nbsp; I believe that we can all win with community&nbsp;participation&nbsp;and evolution through ideas like <strike><a href=\"http://www.prollyfill.org\" target=\"_blank\">prollyfill.org</a></strike> (<span class=\"edit\">edit: unfortunately we lost that domain to a speculator, but <a href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org\">The Extensble Web Manifesto</a> came out of this, and <a href=\"https://chapters.io\">chapters.io</a> and <a href=\"https://wicg.io\">wicg.io</a> now play the respective roles it was advocating</span>)&nbsp;which is trying to team up the community with standards groups and implementers to create a more nimble and natural process based on evolutionary and open ideas... Perhaps that might sound like a marriage of open source ideas and standards that Matthew Butterick would be more happy with... Maybe I should send him an email.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>So what do you think?</p>\n\n\t\t<blockquote class=\"alice\">‚ÄúDo you think I've gone round the bend?\"<br>\n\"I'm afraid so.

In an ideal world, Web pages could be authored by one group of people independently of the visual needs and then another group (designers) could go and write CSS to style it up.  The biggest problem in achieving this ideal was that HTML had such a small number of tags without any real obvious way to add enough semantics to actually accomplish this.  Thus, two things were added very early on:  The humble <code tag-esc=\"\">div</code> and <code tag-esc=\"\">span</code> tags in HTML and the .class in CSS  - the general idea being that the authors of a tree of markup could (quite independently of style concerns) build generic structures and pepper their markup with semantics via classes and ids.</p>\n\n\t<section class=\"sectioning\">\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Theory vs Reality</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>In practice, there have been a relatively few cases (like WordPress blogs, for example) where things are simple and standard enough this has worked out \"pretty well\" and a whole lot more where that is actually not the common experience.  Generally speaking, markup is not created independently of design and changes to design often dictate changes to markup.  Even the attaching and management of classes are changes to markup and if they happen purely to achieve design, well, that's less than desirable.  There have been lots of blogs and articles written over the years about the problems that this created and the creation of new terms like \"classitis\" and \"divitis\" to describe their negative impact.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Still, that was what could get done initially and it was a lot better than what we had prior to it.  Considerably more important, however, is that this was never meant to be the end game - even by the people who created it.  HTML drove forward, creating some new tags and work began on an XML dialect which promised all kinds of things, while CSS followed up almost immediate with CSS 2/2.1 and began CSS 3 (the first draft was published in August 1999, only 3 months after 2.1 went to REC status).  But then, a lot of confusion happened and for a long time, things were pretty stagnant.</p>\n\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Solutions</contextual-heading>\n\t\t<p>The solutions to this are pretty clear, and it's arguable just by looking at the history of drafts and discussions that everyone knows what needs to be done about it:  HTML authors need more semantic abilities (new tags help and so do things like data-* attributes), CSS needs new concepts (regions and generated content for example) and more powerful selectors.   The good news is, things are moving again, though not as quickly as many of us would like...</p>\n\n\t\t<p>My friend, and co-author of Hitch, Clint Hill has been posting some good articles about Hitch over on our blog about how Hitch helps with this last part by allowing authors of CSS to use an expanded set of selectors (Hitch provides a selector plugin model, just like jQuery) right in their CSS, affording them with more expressive powers.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I'll let you <a href=\"https://hitchjs.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/content-based-css-math/\" target=\"_blank\">read the article</a> yourself, but the gist of of it is about a set of selectors for selecting elements based on the numerical qualities of your attributes.  For example, the :-math-greaterthan(attr, number) filter allows you to write CSS like this:</p>\n\n\t\t<code-format type=\"css\">\n\t\t\t<pre>/* Let's visually call out players who achieve this... */\n.player:-math-greaterthan(data-score, 100000){\n    font-weight: bold;\n}</pre>\n\t\t</code-format>\n\n\n\t\t<contextual-heading role=\"heading\" aria-level=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 2.25rem;\">Rationale...</contextual-heading>\n\n\t\t<p>Here's a bit more on the theory behind this selector and how it is relevant to the above.</p>\n\n\t    <ol>\n\t    \t<li>The proposal certainly isn't to throw away .class, merely to use it more \"as envisioned\" in terms described above. If, indeed, you recognized semantic meaning in your tree and maintain it as a class for reasons other than styling - that's great. In our example above, however, it's definitely possible that that is not the case. <em>Clearly there is semantic meaning to the number, but whether a designer decides to attach some arbitrary styling to that or not shouldn't require changes to the tree. This approach allow the appropriate technology to handle the appropriate concerns. From the perspective of a CSS author: You use the classes you have when they are there, and have the expressive power to style things that are purely visual when they are not.</em> The alternative of scattering presentation logic throughout your php or jsp (or whatever) and your javascript to maintain a class in some of these cases is considerably less desirable.</li>\n\n\t    \t<li>CSS has had attribute selectors for a long time which allow you to select attribute values that are contained with in, exactly equal to, start with or end with values expressed in your selector. There have long been conversations, even tentative plans to further expand attribute selectors to something with more \"regExp\" power, there have even been plans for a :content pseudo-class which would allow the same thing with textual content - but it's all string based currently. Attribute selectors already support data-* attributes. Literally all that is added is the ability to write rules that consider something numerically rather than textually.</li>\n\n\t    \t<li>CSS has rich support for algebraic expressions as they relate to structures (children, characters, etc) in the tree and will soon add a calc() function. Again, it makes sense if you think about it that CSS should have appropriate power to do what is required in order to achieve styling without mucking with the tree...</li>\n\t    </ol>\n\n\t    <p>All of this seems considerably inline with the goals and existing approaches of CSS to me and it seems logical to me, but I'd like to hear what you think...</p>\n\n\t    <p>Hitch is a new, open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/bkardell/Hitch/\" target=\"_blank\">hosted on github</a> which we think has a lot of potential.  Check out <a href=\"http://www.hitchjs.com\">http://www.hitchjs.com</a> and the articles on the <a href=\"https://hitchjs.wordpress.com/\">Hitch Blog</a>...
