    <p class="segue">
        There's a worrying new element to W3C politics and I think we need to pitch in and help...
    </p>

    <section class="sectioning">
        <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">Who isn't the only question anymore</contextual-heading>
        <p>
            So, let's just get the simple stuff out of the way:  There are 2 seats up for reelction in the W3C TAG.  If you're not familliar with how the W3C Works or what the TAG is or why it matters, fear not, there's a ~400 word <a href="https://bkardell.com/blog/W3CPrimer.html">Primer for Busy People</a>.  There are 4 nominations for these seats, 2 of them are incumbents.  Both of these incumbents (David Baron and Andrew Betts) haven't been there long and they've both done an excellent job so far.  You can read <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/12/01-tag-nominations">their statements</a> for yourself, but David and Andrew are who I support this go round.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sadly, <em>who</em> to vote for isn't the only question anymore - it's now also <em>how</em> to vote and this is new, likely to confuse and has potentially bad outcomes unless we can really help people be aware of how to prevent outcomes they don't want.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="sectioning">
        <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="2">The New Problem</contextual-heading>
        <p>
            The W3C recently changed how voting works to use a form of preferential voting.  If you live in a country (like the US) that doesn't have preferential voting then you know the mental game that plays out in your head:  Imagine that there are 3 candidates A, B and C.  You really, really like Candidate A, and you really, really <em>dislike</em> Candidate C.  In "simple" systems like this, voting is like putting a coin in a jar and you just count them up.  If you aren't entirely sure that Candidate A can win, then a vote for them actually <em>helps</em> Candidate C by not increasing the competitive count of Candidate B.  Unfortunately, you just can't express your actual preference somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preferential voting systems aim to allow votes to be more expressive, and that's generally a good thing.  However, there are many variants and many implications.  Unfortunately, what is in place currently at the W3C has, what I (and several others) have expressed as an unfortunate side-effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this election, for example I have a strong preference for both Andrew and David.  If you asked me "how much do you support them in this particular election" the answer is "fully".  Another candidate's (Reto) statement makes me actively worry that adding them to the TAG would potentially undo some of what I see as valuable progress.  I'm sure his work is excellent, but for this reason, I support him in this particular election "I don't".  The fourth candidate (Lukasz) is somewhere in between those two postions.  I would be sad to see either David or Andrew not reelected, but I don't inherently worry that it might derail.  In fact, I just don't know a lot about them compared to our current sitting members so in this particular election, all I can say really is I support them "considerably less than fully, but more than 0".
        </p>

        <p>
            In my opinion, my intentions to express my preferences of how I would like my votes to be counted are clear.  Unfortunately, in practice, if 60% of people agreed with exactly this, but 30% of people believed strongly supported our least favorite candidate (the remaining 10% have entirely different opinions), there's still a significant chance that the least favorite candidate of the 60% gets one of the two open seats.  Wait... What? How?
        </p>

        <section class="sectioning">
            <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="3">The dodginess in the system</contextual-heading>
            <p>
                Under the current (new) system  ACs are simply be asked to rank candidates in preferential order.  If, like me, you very strongly prefer both David and Andrew, you still have to rank <em>one</em> as "first".  While it may seem like not that big a deal because, perhaps infact you do <em>very slightly</em> prefer one to the other, here's why it really matters:  "First preference" carries significant weight in the vote counting.  In CSS saying that that "an ID selector is worth more than a class selector" is similar.  One first rank vote turns out to be worth <em>way</em> more than a second preference vote.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, consider this: The statements linked above are displayed alphabetically by last name. David Baron appears first.  Let's imagine that when ACs go to vote, they look to those.  If they feel precisely the way I have described, something as simple as the order of statements can strongly bias them toward placing him David first and Andrew second.  Despite having conceptually 60% "strong support", Andrew winds up with, in all, less than 30% of the "first preference" votes (order of statement biasing makes the split break more toward David, so Andrew gets less than half of those).  Contrarily, if you are a semantic web person or someone who thinks TAG is currently going in the <em>wrong</em> direction with practices like spec reviews and outreach, then Reto seems like your natural your first choice all the time.  That gives him 30% of the "first preference" votes and he wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, despite a clear majority strongly preferring two candidates, only one of them gets elected.
            </p>

        <section class="sectioning">
            <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="3">One weird trick</contextual-heading>
            <p>
                Of course, turning out more votes to shift the percentages further helps, but that alone is a really significant uphill battle toward simply having the meaning of existing votes counted with respect to their intent when they were cast.    So how can help deal with this problem?  Our best bet for this election? Go out of our way to make ACs aware of this problem and ask ACs to flip a coin for their first preference.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know, I can't believe that I just wrote that either. Still, stick with me, because it makes sense.  If a large pool of people "very strongly support" two candidates and they all do this, it means that their breakdown will be roughly even.  We can guarantee that, in the example above, they both have roughly equal "first choice" votes.  In the event of a 30% 3 way tie, they'll also have a nice pile of second votes too.  Our desired outcomes are much more likely.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="sectioning">
            <contextual-heading role="heading" aria-level="3">What can I do?</contextual-heading>
            <p>
                First, I think the most important thing is to help make sure that ACs know about this effect and how to deal with it. To help with that, if you know an AC, please share this with them. If you don't please share it on social media because, believe it or not, we're all wildly connected and you'd be suprised at how easy it is to bump into a connection who does.  Just, basically, help get the word out.  Seriously: Be aware of this and flip a coin if that's how you feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                While you're at it, you might tell them who you as a developer would like to see elected.  Again, in the past, when a number of people have publicly supported candidates, enough ACs have listened to help get them elected.  I do hope very much that you agree with me that David Baron and Andrew Betts should be re-elected, but either way, I want your voice to be heard.
