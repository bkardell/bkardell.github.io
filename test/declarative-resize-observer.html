    <h1>Declarative Resize Observers</h1>
    <p>
      The idea, at a high level, is pretty simple: You can add a <code>resize-observer</code> attribute to any element, at any time, causing a <code>ResizeObsever</code> to either <code>observe</code> that element and reflect relevant meta information into <code>available-height</code> and <code>available-width</code> DOM attributes. Using this, you can simply write CSS using features that we have today in order to create designs that can respond their available size.  No pre-processors or build tools or dependencies, and it's PE based.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a lot of things you could layer atop this, for example, add a pre-processor to make the CSS you write 'feel' better or clever conditional loading of a resize observer polyfill to better suit your needs, etc - but this provides all the plumbing, which, I think, is ultimately the important bit.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Adding support</h1>
      <p>This is a progressively enhanced solution, so begin by designing your element to work on the smallest screen possible - just like you would with <code>@media</code> rules today.  </p>
      <p><a href="https://bkardell.com/test/declarative-resize-observer/declarative-resize-observer.js">Add the script</a> that provides the plumbing (&lt;1k minified/gzipped).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>Adding a declarative resize observer</h1>
      <p>
          Simply add a <code>resize-observer</code> attribute to any element.
      </p>
      <div class="code-sample" resize-observer>
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div resize-observer&gt;
  ...whatever inside
&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        This causes it to be observed.  As resizes (of the element) occur, this will maintain the attributes <code>available-width</code> and <code>available-height</code> on the element, indicating how much space is available for its children.  The values of those attributes are names, derived from consulting the <code>NamedBreakpoints</code> object.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Named Breakpoints</h1>
      <p>
        There are (by default) 11 named breakpoints that increase slowly and provide a decent idea of how much space is available.
      </p>

      <h1>Styling with named breakpoints</h1>

      <p>
        The practical upshot of this is that you can just use these attributes in your CSS selectors and you have something very closely approximating Container Queries.  While CSS attribute selectors cannot express mathematical relationships, they <em>can</em> use partial string based matching to achieve something similar... Examples:
      </p>


      <div class="code-sample" resize-observer>
        <pre><code class="language-css">/* any .foo child of an observed element with less than 668px of available space */
[available-width*="small"] > .foo {
  background-color: orange;
  color: white;
}

/* any .bar child of an observed element with between 568px and 668px of available space */
[available-width^="small"] > .bar {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}

/* any .foo child of an observed element with between 668px and 868px of available space */
[available-width*="medium"] > .foo {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

/* any .foo child of an observed element with over than 1004px of available space */
[available-width*="large"] > .foo {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}

/* ... and so on ... */</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        By using named rather than arbitrary values, we kind of greatly simplify the problem.  By increasing at about 100px a shot, there is a goodly amount of expressive power here regardless of what you're trying to design.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h1>Demonstration</h1>
      <p>
        This page includes the following CSS:
      </p>
      <div class="code-sample" resize-observer>
        <pre><code class="language-css">[available-width*="x-small"] {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}

[available-width="small"],[available-width*="medium"] {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

[available-width*="large"] {
  background-color: green;
  color: white;
}</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        Thus, observed things will, by default, show a red background.  Things with between 568px and 868px of available space for their children to lay out in will show a blue background, and things with more space will show a green background.
      </p>
      <div id="ro-one" resize-observer>
        This element is a resize observer
      </div>
      <div resize-observer class="layout" style="width: 45%;">
        <p>This element is a resize observer with 45% width</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tiny" class="layout" style="width: 25%;">
        <p>This element is 25% width, click it to add attr after the fact.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The code samples also use declarative resize-observers to re-size/style effectively based on available space</p>

      <p class="note">
        Note: This demonstration styles the background colors of the image being observed itself.  Normally the use of
        a resize observer will be to style <em>children</em> of the observed element based on available space. The rest of this document explains in more detail.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h1><code>display: contents</code> by default</h1>
        <p>Because children of an observed element are styled as <code>display:contents</code> by default.  This means that whatever fixed sizes they might have don't generate boxes for purposes of this measurement, so you can't 'blowup' the measurement by putting too much content in there.</p>

        <div id="ro-two" resize-observer class="layout">
            <p>
              This paragraph, for example, is in a 75% width container with styles that suggest that it's <code>max-height:100px</code> and it's <code>width: 200rem;</code>. Its width would cause <em>it</em> to impact things, normally, because it has considerably more content than will fit on pretty much any monitor (75% will be smaller than 200rem).  However, because of <code>display:contents</code>, it will remain the size of its container.
            </p>
            <p>
              This paragraph follows the same rules.  If you override the <code>display</code> property of these elements to be block or something, the display will get weird.  Don't do that... Most of the time.
            </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>Laying out children</h1>
        <p>
          "But hey," you're thinking, "part of what I want to do is lay out these children... how am I supposed to do that".  Well, if for example, the element you are observing has 'display: grid' and uses relative units, you'll be fine, then just set the display of the children appropritately.  Here is an example which sets up a scenario in which the next container is inside a media query and has 80% width.  When that means available space is &lt;468px, I'd like that to be displayed in a single column, otherwise I would like it to be set in two equal columns...</p>

        <div class="code-sample" resize-observer>
<pre><code class="language-css">#ro-three {
    width: 100%;
    display: grid;
    margin: 1rem auto;
  }

  [available-width]#ro-three {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }

  [available-width]#ro-three > * {
    display: block;
    padding: 1rem;
  }

  #ro-three:not([available-width*="small"]) {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div id="ro-three" resize-observer class="layout">
            <p>
              This is inside <code>#ro-three</code>. We've got a grid that responds to available space.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the size observer should tell us the truth too.
            </p>
        </div>

      </section>


      <section>
        <h1>What about cycles?</h1>
        <p>Given this, the question becomes, what happens if you write some code like this:</p>
        <div class="code-sample" resize-observer>
          <pre><code class="language-css">[available-width*="small"]#convoluted {
  width: 1000px;
}
:not([available-width="small"])#convoluted {
  width: 300px;
}
          </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Doesn't that create a cycle in which becomming small makes it big, and then becomming big in turn makes it small and so on, forever and ever?
        </p>

        <p>
          No
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's what happens:  When the observed thing is evaluated, it is measured, the observer briefly disconnects paying attention and updates the attribute.  (In theory, this should happen "automatically" with a resize observer but for some reason it doesn't seem to work quite right).  The next measure caused by this resizing is ignored.  At that point, the element is a fixed size and will no longer pump resize events.  Here's one such example:
        </p>

        <p id="convoluted" resize-observer>Why this may appear to have the wrong color is explained in this section.</p>

        <p>
          Yes, that looks wrong.  But there is no "right" because we asked for nonsense.  If we ask it to reflect variable size, and then fix the size, we've removed the variable size aspect of the equation and this seems a reasonable thing to do.  Just...  don't do that.  But, at least if you mess up, you wont bring send things burning to the ground.
        </p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <conextual-help>My implmentation: PE, polyfill and approximation</conextual-help>
        <p>
          As I said, this uses a PE approach and your site should be totally usable whether through a browser that supports <code>ResizeObserver</code> or not.  But, let's be honest, right now, that means Chrome. Since we're talking about smaller pieces here (you should still use media queries for your main layouts), it is entirely possible that you're ok with just 1 design that works everywhere for that media object, but feels so much better in Chrome.  But, it's also possible that you're not.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not, there are some <a href="https://github.com/WICG/ResizeObserver/issues/3">polyfills you can find through WICG</a>.  If you like, you can use one of those to greatly improve the number of people who will see your improved, responsive designs.  <a href="https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill">This one is probably the most popular</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
          However, this gets kind of tricky.  Minified and gzipped the polyfills can be a few times the size of my plumbing.  For a large number of sites, a lot of the handling provided is unnecessary.  As such, I've included a very small, very basic approximation that you can try out (included in the code) by simply including the attribute <code>pseudo-observe-fallback</code> on your HTML element.  This makes it easy to play with it and test it out and, for a number of sites, will be entirely enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only you can really determine what's best for your use cases, but I hope I've made it easier for more people to experiment.
