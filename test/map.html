                Wood paneling covers one wall containing a stone fireplace that has long been sealed up.

                A green couch and some end tables border two other walls and an old, cathode-ray television sits on a stand in the corner.

                A large window looks out to the north.

                    require some special kind of interaction to get through it.

                x-exits always have a leads-to attribute with a readable name.. some other
                   x-scene should have a name attribute to match.
