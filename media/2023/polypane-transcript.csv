00:22.57	bkardell	So maybe like listening to all of this. It. It seems like a lot of people will think like well gee why like couldn't sort of like Google or Apple or somebody like sort of buy that because they they hire people to um. Design those tools and to build those tools and to manage those tools and every thing and you like you have done a lot of that work and like probably you know is there some universe in which you can imagine ah is that where you're going with that Eric.
