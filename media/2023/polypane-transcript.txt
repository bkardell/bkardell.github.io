Eric Meyer
Okay, so we have started recording and welcome to agalia chats I'm Eric Meyer I'm a developer advocate at Agalia and we have a guest with us this week ah Killian volkoff who.

00:11.56
bkardell
I'm Brian Cardell I'm also a developer advocate at agaia and.

00:19.61
Eric Meyer
Has created a number of pieces of software over the years um but we're going to talk about 1 in particular but Killian please introduce yourself.

00:29.10
Kilian
Hi everyone I'm Killian um as you'll probably be hearing throughout the podcast I am Dutch. Ah and I'm the like Eric Myers said book. Let's do that again. Hi I'm Killian. I'm Dutch as you can probably hear from my accent I'm the creator of polypane and a whole bunch of other projects that I hope to discuss with you guys today.

00:56.55
Eric Meyer
So yeah, um, so before we start with that. Um, sometimes we like to ask ask guests and particularly guest who are writing code. How did you get started with coding like what's sort of your journey to this point in a. In a nutshell.

01:15.60
Kilian
Um I think like most people I started out playing games as a kid and then wanting to make games as a kid and then somehow. Around the age of ten Eleven I convinced my dad to get me a copy of borlandc plus plus and like ah an instruction course. So I got through the first chapter in the instruction course which was all like text and input based like.

01:33.27
Eric Meyer
Oh.

01:47.39
Kilian
Ah, fill in your name fill in your address here's your nice looking address cards in the dos terminal that was prompt. Ah but then chapter 2 started and it was like okay now draw a chessboard on the screen and that was kind of a.

01:48.19
Eric Meyer
Right.

01:57.96
Eric Meyer
Ah.

02:06.36
Kilian
Too big a leap for me at that at that point. So yeah, so I I kind of forgot about that. Ah, but in the meantime my had also discovered that websites were also built with code. Ah so I started playing around with that.

02:09.16
Eric Meyer
Ah, okay, okay.

02:22.50
Eric Meyer
And then.

02:26.40
Kilian
You know, making my own little websites in first in words then in front page then you know editing the things in in notepad and it just kind of you know went from there.

02:37.66
Eric Meyer
Yeah, okay, and art. Are you back to doing C plus plus now or are you writing in something else.

02:46.50
Kilian
Ah, so everything I do is in Javascript I still don't know any c plus plus.

02:50.22
Eric Meyer
Ah, okay, cool. Yeah, so um, so as was mentioned you are the creator maintainer coder of ah software called polypain. What.

02:51.28
bkardell
That Wow that's amazing.

03:07.54
Eric Meyer
Can you describe that in a way that sort of Conveys the experience to someone who hasn't used it.

03:12.37
Kilian
Yeah, so I usually say like polypae is a website or ah I usually say polypain is a browser for building websites instead of for browsing websites. Ah but what it comes down to is that it's actually. Like everything I want my browser to do as I'm building a website like all the information I need all the handy tools I need etc I'm just combining that in 1 app and trying to make me as productive as possible and to make. Process of building a website or a web app or what have you as fun as possible.

03:55.68
Eric Meyer
I Okay and so poly pain that name. What is what does that name refer to in the experience.

04:03.20
Kilian
So it. It started out like the idea of polypane started out in 2015 when I just switch over from photoshop to sketch for website design work and at that time. Catch had something called ah frames. No it. It wasn't called frames. But now everyone calls it frames. Ah and photoshop didn't have that and what that meant was that in sketch at this one big canvas and you could put your mobile and your tablets and your desktop designs.

04:27.64
Eric Meyer
Okay, so.

04:41.66
Kilian
On that one canvas side by side so you had a really good overview of your website at different sizes as as you're designing it and it made things really easy to compare and and check if you're for example, consistent. If things you know, become larger in a way that is actually buildable which at the time you know, very often. Ah frontend developers would get very annoyed because. Ah, design on desktop and a design on mobile had nothing to do with each other and having them side by side like that just made that really really obvious so that was a real productivity boost. But then you went back to the browser know why it designs. Ah. Ah website and then I went to implement it and suddenly all of that was gone and I was just staring at 1 thing at a time again and having to resize my browser etc. Um, so I got really annoyed and the thing I do when I get really annoyed is I build something too. Fix the issue. Ah so I built this really small prototype that was essentially 3 iframes duct tape together with ah an address bar above it. Um, and then you know at some point. Um.

06:03.20
Eric Meyer
Okay.

06:12.73
Kilian
You have to name a thing ah and this just it just popped into my head like you know Bully pane. It has alliteration it. It means the thing there's multiple panes windows or or view ports.

06:30.16
Kilian
Ah, so that's what started out as like let me see my websites in these bunch of different permutations that I need to build for. Um, so that I don't have to do all that stuff manually.

06:44.79
Eric Meyer
Right? And are they still iframes like frames or iframes duct tape together or have you switched over to some other different construct.

06:53.14
Kilian
Ah, so they they were ifframes for a bit but you have to do a lot of really weird stuff to make iframes behave. Well essentially not like iframes because Iframes have all sorts of writes that you don't actually want them to have in in this situation. Ah, so right now the app uses something called Web Views Ah, which ah so Poly Pane is based on Electron which uses chromium for the rendering So it. It inherits a bunch of these um like chromium.

07:15.33
Eric Meyer
And.

07:30.96
Kilian
Things that you don't really get if you're building websites like there's no concept of a webview on your website but it is something in Chrome the browser where they use these things to show different ah different web contents that isn't websites.

07:50.81
Kilian
Ah, so you can use that in Electron and the way that's actually implemented is that under the hood. It is a regular ifframe. So. It's technically an out of process i-frame which is nice because then it doesn't interact with. Whatever page. It's being shown in and then there's ah a web view reper that makes it so that you can interact with it on like a system level where you can you know, inspect the network and change. Properties of like the the renderer itself.

08:30.22
Eric Meyer
Deep neep.

08:35.82
bkardell
Yeah, it's It's pretty amazing Actually um and it's even more amazing that you've um, you know you've basically you built a ah browser that does some really unique sorts of things targeted At. Really developers. Um, so it's It's a little bit like ah a Dev Toolsols focus browser with some really great Dev Toolsol Like if if you were to give devtools its own like yeah url and Concepts like these pains.

09:12.47
Kilian
Um.

09:13.62
bkardell
Um, it it's ah you also have like lots of other tools in there that aren't simply about these pains they have to do with like um accessibility focuses and things like that right.

09:25.10
Kilian
Yeah, yeah, so it really started out as you know, just just responsive design. But that's only one of the things that you need to work on if you want to build a good website and. You know that's whenever I build websites. That's what I try to do ah and and I think a good website. You know it runs on every device and it works for every User. Um.

09:54.89
Eric Meyer
Preach testify.

09:59.15
Kilian
But so yeah, like like I said in the beginning I'm just adding everything that I need and that I think other people need and so of course a ah major part of that is tooling around accessibility.

10:16.35
Kilian
Ah, because one of the ironic things about like quote unquote regular browsers is that they do a whole lot of work to compensate for bad web development because they're user agents if they can get something on the screen for the user and it. You know it mostly works and they can mostly interact with it then that's a win for the browser. Um, so they actually hide a whole lot of things that you could consider issues because for the user. Like for the regular user for a user that has full motor capabilities and ah perfect eyesight etc. They won't notice these things So I have to flip that around in my browser and and actually make it. Easy to figure out where the browser tries to compensate for you know, lack of quality.

11:26.00
Eric Meyer
I oop sorry I was still muted. Ah these things happen. Yeah so um, in using polypeen and I realized that we we didn't make clear that this is a it's a it's an electron app. It is Macintosh only or no, okay, awesome. Well okay, um, so it's an electron app up and it started out as.

11:44.60
Kilian
No it it. It runs on all 3 platforms for if you include Chromebooks.

12:01.77
Eric Meyer
Like you said like sort of a like a responsive checker as it were um, you know drawing on that experience that you had where you could have multiple frames on a single canvas and and that's what it's like being on being in polypain. Um, and.

12:05.60
Kilian
Um, yeah.

12:21.23
Eric Meyer
It has you know, easy ways to set up like it'll detect your breakpoints and stuff like that. But yeah, having that extra you know the the extra features like accessibility and you know being able to check colors and and and that sort of that sort of thing. It really does. It makes it makes a really interesting sort of full-featured development environment and the um scroll linking was the other thing that I was I was trying to remember the name of but yeah, like if you if you click a link or you scroll a page in 1 pane. It will do that in all of the pains was that hard to do easy to do.

12:55.38
Kilian
Um, so I I think I've rebuild that 5 or 6 times. So yeah, it's it's.

13:00.41
Eric Meyer
That scrolling and link link ah scroll and Click linking.

13:12.57
bkardell
It's I expect that there are some some challenges like you don't like anything like this I expect you're probably the same Well probably everyone is the same like you see this and you come up with a.

13:13.42
Kilian
Quite difficult. Um.

13:15.22
Eric Meyer
Ah.

13:27.80
bkardell
Ah, wonder what would happen in this case and then you just do it and you kind of try to stump the browser right? like um but I got to thinking like well sometimes there's like a little bit of thing That's only there on the desktop and it's not you know when you shrink it down is not there anymore because it's just hidden. It's like well it's.

13:42.12
Kilian
Um, yeah.

13:47.39
Kilian
Um.

13:47.80
bkardell
It's not critical. We can't really fit it on the screen. So we're going to just hide that and one of those things could be a button or a link right? and and so you know what happens when you interact with an element That's only in one of the views and it it seems like it deals with it just fine because I guess probably you only.

13:53.35
Kilian
Um, yeah.

14:03.61
Kilian
So the the the trick is yeah so the the trick is I don't do anything if the button isn't there and it's It's really that simple. Ah so the you know ah a lot of people.

14:07.48
bkardell
Spawn to 1 of them right.

14:22.65
Kilian
When they see like the click syncing they think I know I if if you click a button in 1 pane I click the button in all the other panes. That's very easy to say but click the button can mean a whole bunch of different things. Um.

14:38.98
bkardell
Um.

14:40.14
Kilian
Lot of people envision that I figure out you know where the button is on the screen and then do a mouse events on the X y position. Um, but of course that that can really that doesn't make sense because the button might be in ah in a very different place.

14:58.92
bkardell
Yeah, probably act. Yeah.

14:59.83
Kilian
Ah, and you you also? yeah and and you also can't like ah like fudge it like you know this is twice as wide. So I'll I'll just do x times 2 ah because it it can literally be any place else.

15:18.67
Kilian
Um, so what? what I do is I find the same element in the dom and then I I execute click events on that and if the element isn't in the dom. Ah then there there is nothing to click and so the click doesn't happen.

15:38.13
bkardell
But.

15:38.44
Kilian
Um, and you know that if you say that out loud again it it sounds pretty simple. Um, but you know it it. It took quite some iteration to figure out that that is the thing that makes it work.

15:58.18
bkardell
But I think that um so for people who aren't aware you have a tab that looks a lot like any tab in any other browser at the top that has a single yeah url right.

16:11.96
Kilian
Um, yeah.

16:16.00
bkardell
And I think if you like Click a link That's only shown in one. It will cause a top level navigation which acts on the top thing and so it actually does happen for a whole bunch of things in all the pains right? like because yeah, so that that was actually.

16:29.80
Kilian
Um, yeah.

16:35.38
bkardell
You know, really kind of surprising to me and then I was like oh yeah, now that I think about it that really makes a lot of sense. It would be a lot simpler than you kind of think it is um for a whole bunch of cases and then probably you know well I don't know you just let the other cases go because they're.

16:46.54
Kilian
Um.

16:53.74
bkardell
Probably not that interesting. Um.

16:56.18
Kilian
Yeah, so in in in this example, if you have a link that's available in one of the panes but not in all the others because because of sizing. Um, what the browser does is it first tries to ah. Sync the click event and that click event might trigger a navigation event. So the browser will wait a bit ah upon like acting upon that navigation event to see what happens in all the other panes because if all the other pans also start. Navigation event then the browser just has to follow. You know it. It has to receive the new yeah url and then display it but it doesn't actually have to instruct all the paints to go to that? Yeah url. But then if that doesn't happen. You know if that click. Can't be synced then we fall back to syncing the navigation. The url instead. It's preferable to have the click synced because then you have all these um. Like benefits of intact, history, etc. Um, but you know at the end of a cycle like that's the main goal for poly pain is that all pains show the same page.

18:23.87
Kilian
Ah, so we yeah, there's this fallback mechanism to it.

18:32.98
Eric Meyer
Okay, yeah, so the the the action of last resort is well I couldn't find anything to do but we've moved to another page So I'm just going to drag this other pain to the same page which makes sense. Um, yeah, so I mean.

18:43.30
Kilian
Exactly yeah.

18:50.69
Eric Meyer
Like you say it's ah it's a browser for developers. Are you familiar at all with Firefox developer edition. So yeah, it feels like Firefox tried a thing like this but it it didn't really it failed to to catch on. Let's put it that way. Um.

18:54.83
Kilian
Yeah.

19:05.89
Kilian
And.

19:09.50
Eric Meyer
Do you feel like polypne is very similar to developer edition in in terms of like the experience of using it or is it like really different.

19:18.27
Kilian
So I think it's really different. Ah Firefox developer edition um is just regular firefox.

19:31.83
Kilian
And I'm I'm trying to word it in a way that doesn't sound condescending because I don't mean that at all. Um, but like it's Firefox with a theme that fits better for developers and easier access to the available developer tools.

19:35.49
Eric Meyer
And.

19:49.47
Kilian
All of which is nice but the developer tools of Firefox and for that matter of Chrome of edge etc. They are confined to the area where. The development tools are and the address bar isn't the developer tool the ah the web content showing your website isn't part of the developer tools. The ah, all the the browser chrome isn't part of. The developer tools they're locked away because that's what the regular product demands. Um, if 99% of your users are developers. You definitely don't want them to accidentally stumble. On the developer tools because they they think they'll they'll have hacked their entire computer or whatever. Ah, so they're they're confined by that constraints where the developer tools as a concept country break out of that little box. They're in.

21:03.50
Eric Meyer
Okay, whereas Polyoppene puts them all front and center and a a thing that I've wondered is um, how much or how little. For that matter work. Did you have to do to expose the the web inspector to the various pains.

21:27.63
Kilian
So poly pane actually ships with two web inspectors. There's the the Chrome one which I get essentially for free like I have to do some trickery to display it.

21:31.99
Eric Meyer
Oh.

21:43.97
Kilian
In a place that isn't like right next to the pane or inside a pane. But other than that I get the entire chromium developer tools for free, but the chromium developer tools are built to interact with a single webpage.

21:49.92
Eric Meyer
Um, okay.

22:03.46
Kilian
At a time and if you're in polypain and you want to you know change some stuff edit some content or change some colors or edit some css then obviously you want that to happen in in all the pains at once.

22:20.50
Eric Meyer
And right.

22:23.78
Kilian
You know that's the thing it does. Ah so I've also built my own elements inspector and my own console to to enable that where ah they consolidate the styling from all the paints and the dom from other paints.

22:43.69
Kilian
And then allow you to edit that ah in in each pane in one go so that took a whole lot of work and it still definitely doesn't do everything. That's the chromium. Element inspector does ah but I think like you know the eighty twenty rule um you can definitely get very very far with just the polymate poly pane elements inspector.

23:19.87
Eric Meyer
Yeah wow I I was going to ask. But you said that sounds like it was a lot of work and yeah, ah, that seems like it would be very difficult was there like is there 1 point of creating that. Multiview unified inspector that like stands out to you as that was ah particularly difficult to to make work the way you wanted it to or was it all.

23:48.82
Kilian
Um, I mean I mean it was all pretty difficult so you know getting the css for for everything is pretty hard. Um and then parsing the css is okay except when you run into. Ah, like rendering specific bugs where the css object model in Chromium ah isn't being truthful so have to work around that. Ah, but definitely like ah ah.

24:20.22
Kilian
Ah, big difficult feature that I recently added was support for container queries where um, no, if you use container queries on your page then certain this the size of certain elements is going to influence the styling.

24:24.88
Eric Meyer
So yeah, okay.

24:39.34
Kilian
Of their ah their descendants. The the elements inside of them so in ah in an element inspector. You want to know whether or not you reach that like container threshold.

24:58.51
Kilian
And then show the styling that you know is actually being applied well for media queries. You can use Javascript with window match media to figure out like which media query is actually true for the current page at. This current time. Ah for containers that doesn't exist. So if you have in your css like at container minimum width of 400 pixels then there's nothing that you can ask the browser to say you know is this elements.

25:19.97
Eric Meyer
Um, yeah.

25:37.17
Kilian
Does it match this container query or is this container query valid for this element. So I I essentially had to where essentially I had to implement that myself. So I now have a whole bunch of codes that you know can take an element and a matched. Container query and then figure out whether or not that container query actually applies at at this moment and unfortunately what that comes down to is a whole lot of like parsing strings. Ah because if you if you think of ah. Ah, container query. Let's say it's let's keep it simple and it's just the inline size. It's just the the width there are actually like 5 or so different notations that you can use to. Ah. To say like is this thing wider than 400 pixels. You can do minwidth you can do ah with greater than you can do number smaller than with ah you can do ranged media queries so you can put with in the middle and then have 2 values side by side. So you have to look through all of those cases and see you know which one is the user actually trying to convey and then which is actually the value and um is it for width or inline size or is it for block size for heights. Um.

27:13.16
Kilian
So it's it's a whole bunch of if statements essentially and at the end I know whether or not a given block of Css is actually being applied to the page or not um and of course all of that would have been much less work. If I could have just done like element dot match container. But that doesn't exist at least it doesn't exist yet. They're they're working on it. It's speced, but it's it's not in browsers yet. Ah so when it lands I can delete a whole bunch of code which is you know. The leading code code is always nice. So I look forward to that. But for now this is what I have to do to make stuff like that work.

28:02.43
Eric Meyer
Go Brian.

28:06.20
bkardell
So um, on our podcast. We talk a lot about open source and ecosystems around open source and really a lot about browsers browser engines the projects that around them. Ah.

28:09.59
Kilian
A.

28:22.48
bkardell
Couple episodes ago. We did two back to back with novel engines that are being developed so servo recently a Galley came back and picked up where Moola left off on Servo where.

28:30.10
Kilian
Um.

28:34.80
Kilian
Yeah.

28:39.58
bkardell
Really helping champion in that with some new funding and we also talk about lady Birdd um, which I think at the time didn't have ah any funding and it seems that it's it's recently getting some which is nice. Um, but your. Ah, browser is interesting in in sort of both regards in that it is um, it's not a novel engine. It is the chromium engine like it is the chromium project I guess that on top of that electron is built right? um.

29:06.60
Kilian
Um, no.

29:11.55
Kilian
Um, Moon. Yes.

29:15.79
bkardell
And so it's like a downstream browser project. Ah that would put it in the camp of you know like Samsung internet or opera or brave. You know those those kind of other chromium browsers. Um.

29:34.80
Kilian
Um.

29:34.61
bkardell
But but it's also not developed with C Plus plus I don't know in those other cases. What those other browsers are so hard to say but um, yeah, yeah, but I don't want to make assumptions. Yeah.

29:45.40
Kilian
Most are C Plus plus I think a few of them. Oh okay, then then we'll skip over that.

29:53.76
bkardell
I don't I'm I'm sorry like I don't want to make any assumptions because I don't know like Opera is we'll cut this but like Opera is completely proprietary now. So you know like we not now. It's always been completely proprietary. So like we don't know we we expect based on its history that it's just.

30:03.94
Kilian
Um, yeah.

30:13.36
bkardell
C Plus Plus but they they could have switched again. We'll cut this but like brave also was an Electron app Originally I don't know if you knew that. But.

30:14.46
Kilian
Um, yeah.

30:21.68
Kilian
Sort of yeah so they they actually um had an Electron fork called move on which was Electron with a whole bunch of like additional security things. Ah.

30:26.82
bkardell
Yeah, right.

30:34.65
bkardell
Um, yeah.

30:37.95
Kilian
And then they abandoned that and most of the security stuff was ported back to Electron Ah, but now they? yeah yeah, sorry that that that you know that checks my boxes.

30:43.51
bkardell
Yeah, So anyway, we'll we'll cut all that I just I didn't want to get into like any of that subtlety. You know, um, you know it's okay, um I don't know well. Try to imagine where we cut that. But um, but your yours is unique in that it's not ah, another CC plus plus kind of um application Port of Chromium um, it's also.

30:58.92
Kilian
And.

31:15.80
bkardell
Unique though in that it is specifically targeted for developers and that means it's an interesting niche right? Um, so I assume that because you know I've seen a bunch of people tweet about it and tuwed about it and skiete about like all the all the.

31:33.49
Kilian
Um, of.

31:35.36
bkardell
Whatever words we're using for those um people talk about it. They blog about it and um, clearly there are some people who use it right? Um, and but it's also not a free product right.

31:50.93
Kilian
Yeah, yeah, so that yeah, that's right? Um, so I so as I said I started this in 2015 as just a fun site project then from like.

32:06.90
Kilian
Around 2017 to like somewhere in 2018 ah it was a public beta so everyone could use it for free and then in 2019 I started working on it full time.

32:21.70
bkardell
Um.

32:25.10
Kilian
Ah, and in order to work on something full time. You need to have income to be able to do groceries and pay rent etc. Ah so yeah, so it's it's a paid product. Ah because I yeah I get to live and then build this full time.

32:33.41
Eric Meyer
And.

32:34.79
bkardell
Um.

32:43.41
Kilian
In in exchange for people subcribing to it.

32:48.13
bkardell
Yeah, it's very like it's very interesting because like the fact that it is a niche tool for developers really changed the equation right? like I I don't think that. Ah you know if if you made your um. I Think it does actually have a mode where it can just act like a regular browser right? like does it.

33:10.83
Kilian
Um, yeah, but it it does but it's not really, no no I I tell people not to use it as their daily driver.

33:11.74
bkardell
But people. Yeah you don't you don't use that as your daily drive right? Yeah and I don't think that if you right? and I don't think that if you tried to do that like there would be much chance that anybody would. Be willing to pay for it at this moment in history. You know like and it's not about your product. It's about like if like if Google said tomorrow. It's going to cost ten bucks a month to use Chrome Firefox would.

33:41.30
Kilian
In.

33:46.96
bkardell
Jump through the roof and market share right? because like that's just out of the norm right? It's out of the norm nobody would nobody would pay that So you you've shifted the equation just subtly and it like people are like sure It's a tool.

33:49.15
Kilian
Sounds good.

34:04.19
Kilian
And.

34:05.90
bkardell
Course we'll pay for it right? Um, not everybody probably but ah but it doesn't take an astounding number of people to help fund a project you know, um at like ten bucks a month. Um, so.

34:25.60
bkardell
Yeah, that's amazing to me like and it and it works out pretty well I Guess yeah.

34:28.40
Kilian
It It is to me as well. Yeah, so um, having developers as a target audience is you know it's a blessing and a curse. Um.

34:40.30
bkardell
Sure and.

34:44.79
Kilian
You will not find people that are better at sending in feature requests or bug reports. Um, you know I Yeah so ah so ah, like a large number.

34:53.78
bkardell
I Yeah I didn't even think of that but probably probably that Definitely true. Yeah.

35:03.77
Kilian
Of features are things that I would never have come up with and it's just some person emailing me like you know I get everything from like a single line like wouldn't it be cool if it did x 2 Ah. I've mocked up this demo video of a new feature that I think should you shoot addds and it's like the most bullish thing ever and and everything in between but like you said ah paying for browsers is weird. Um, and. On top of that developers are very much used to not paying for their tooling increasingly. So um, so that that is you know a hard battle you you really have to convince people that you know this is.

35:56.40
Kilian
This is actually worth the price of admission. Um, yeah, no so you know that's that's what Ah what the product needs to do it really needs to convince people and and part of that is also.

35:58.37
bkardell
Yeah, yeah, and at least I'm sorry.

36:14.91
Kilian
What? Ah what I found is that a lot of developers. They don't consider their own time to be worth anything so saving time isn't really interesting to them.

36:32.69
bkardell
Yeah, yeah I mean.

36:34.44
Kilian
So Even if if even if they're faster then that that doesn't mean that they think it's worth it whereas if they take that equation and they show to their Manager. You know their manager might cry. Um, so I you know. Parts of like my marketing if you will is you know helping developers figure out that you know actually the time you spend and the work you do have value and that means that you can ask your employer for stuff that makes the time you spend. More effective more efficient, more Fun. Ah and your employer will be happy to do that because if you as a developer are happy and productive. That means that you know the work is getting done better. That's of higher quality. There's no less. Ah. Remedial Work. You have to do later on so it's it's better for everyone. But you don't get to that point if you don't realize at the beginning like my my time is valuable so that's been Interesting. You know seeing. Seeing how people respond to that messaging.

37:52.21
bkardell
And yeah I like how you have this tiered system to where it's like for an individual developer I think it's nine Nine Ten dollars a month and then and buy 1 for your company. That's I think up to 10 is that right up to 10 people and then you can buy 1 for the whole enterprise which is I guess.

38:01.32
Kilian
Um, yeah.

38:11.20
bkardell
You know, a lot almost almost unlimited. Maybe I don't know there must be some limit but um, but yeah like I like the way that you do that because I guess per user it kind of even goes down and like you say to convince a single developer. Well if you're doing like contract work and you.

38:11.86
Kilian
Um, yeah, but.

38:31.60
bkardell
Just stop and do the math for a minute like how much time and and um, you know anxiety does this have to save you to be worth $9 a month like it almost nothing right? I mean like it has to make the tiniest.

38:31.34
Kilian
Me.

38:39.24
Kilian
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so so for for for? yeah yeah for for an average you know, whatever average means. But I I.

38:50.69
bkardell
And to be worth it.

38:58.93
Kilian
Like two years ago I did some checking like what's the rough average that I can name like globally ah and that's if you save 11 minutes per month then it pays for itself that that's roughly your breakeven points and on the websites I have. Ah, like calculator that you can fill in your own details. Um, and then yeah, but but it it that makes it more tangible for people right? Um, but.

39:22.80
Eric Meyer
Oh wow, That's really smart.

39:32.32
Eric Meyer
Um, yeah, yeah.

39:36.89
Kilian
The the thing that I haven't really figured out yet or cracked is that you know this is time saved during development ah and some of that is literally. You're not resizing your browser which takes seconds. But if you do that. You know dozens or hundreds of times a day over a month that really adds up and you know resizing your browser isn't intellectually stimulating. Um, so you probably don't want to do that? Um, but like the real value is in. All the stuff that you don't miss during developments because we all know that when you as a developer think you're done and the website goes live and it shipped to users and then you know a couple of months late or a couple of weeks later it turns out that you weren't done at all, you missed a whole bunch of stuff. Um, for various reasons that only came up now because you know now people are interacting with the sites or now the customer finally looks at it now it has content so they actually understand what's going on. All these things but what happens is that? no you work on a project. You think it's done you ship it. You start working on on other projects and then your manager comes back and he says you know that project from a month ago yeah here's a word file with all the stuff you need to fix or.

41:13.60
Kilian
Jira tickets or whatever and at that point it's so much more time intensive and annoying to go back to that project and figure out where everything is and fix the things and validate it and then ship it again compared to. No during developments you already found that weird breakpoints where you missed that things are actually now 2 columns and they don't quite fit but it's not an iphone and it's not an ipad. It's rights in the middle. Ah, and you never bother checking that. If you don't use polypae whereas in polypae that sort of comes up naturally so you see that you can fix it because you're working on it anyway and move on with your day and you never end up having that remedial work or you know never say never but you you get a whole lot. Less issues because you catch all these things during developments and as you can tell for how long this explanation was it's very hard to ah to explain people that that's what's happening.

42:24.20
bkardell
So I think you also get some nice new tools that you didn't have anywhere else I mean like the the view of all them is really nice for you in the moment but also like you have this like ability to do like Ah um. Like a screenshot of the whole the whole thing and that would be typically much harder to um if you're trying to do this manually like I've tried to do that where you've like manually finagling these windows you know trying to get them.

42:44.17
Kilian
Um.

42:52.37
Kilian
Um, yeah.

42:57.21
Kilian
Um, yeah.

42:57.87
bkardell
So you can get a nice screenshot with no noise or anything. Um, so I I mean I like I'm totally sold that it's worth it for somebody who builds websites to have a tool like this at that that price and it that blows my mind because at the beginning of this I Thought that was um.

43:15.86
bkardell
Like not a thing that I would agree with um, but yeah I mean it I can see I can see the usefulness and when I think about you know what it costs you to save that it.

43:19.40
Kilian
Ah, how come.

43:31.48
bkardell
It definitely will. It's definitely worked that much. You know to a lot of people I think um so because this is effectively like a proprietary product is. It's not on Github right? like nobody else can contribute to it. Yeah.

43:45.13
Kilian
No, no, it's It's just me.

43:50.94
bkardell
Um I don't I don't want to put you on the spot So feel free to say no you just you don't want to talk about this but um, you know we have talked about how um it is.

43:56.73
Kilian
Sure.

44:09.68
bkardell
Think about how to edit this but it is possible for people to make a downstream browser right? That is ah so like let's say you know Chromium is the open source project.

44:17.50
Kilian
Um.

44:25.67
bkardell
And then all the browsers even Chrome are you know downstream of that and then they the way you you can easily get market share is to ship it on a device that you also make or. With an operating system that you also make um and that just inevitably the power of defaults is very strong right? like you will you will capture a very very significant overwhelming portion of the people who use that operating system or buy that product right.

45:02.88
bkardell
Um, and so there are some downstream products that have significant share and they also frequently. Ah then have their own stores which they monetize and they can monetize their default search. Um, So yeah, they can be lucrative even right like they can. They can make a lot of money and there's nothing in open source that says they have to contribute anything back. You know and.

45:26.10
Kilian
Mean.

45:41.21
bkardell
I Like I Certainly don't want to imply that you know somebody who can just you know the the product more or less breaks even or something like that. You know they also should pay back but like I think that there is like some point where things start getting very lucrative where. You know like you would hope that people would want to put back into the system that that supports them. Do you know what? I mean and I wonder if there's like any thing you imagine where like you would like somehow contribute.

46:09.38
Kilian
Um.

46:19.66
bkardell
Back Downstream via whatever like back your stack or you know like just even um, some collective or something that's working Upstream in Chromium you know.

46:33.28
Kilian
So I am part of the Electron Governance team. So I I mostly help out in the ecosystem there because again I don't know C Plus Plus um so I I you know I try to contribute.

46:36.43
bkardell
Okay.

46:49.53
Kilian
Back that way. There's also stuff that I've built for polypain that I now ship in in other tools for free. Um I can be found in the ah like the.

46:59.98
bkardell
Cool.

47:06.49
Kilian
The Chromium Bug reports quite often. Ah, and I'm I'm hoping to start contributing to the Chromium devtools. Um, and perhaps the Chromium devtools protocol as well. Um, because by nature of the things I do.

47:14.57
bkardell
Nice.

47:25.92
Kilian
I tend to find a lot of like the gaps in there. Um, but I I haven't started that yet. Usually I get stuck I figure out it's some bug. Ah I try to find um.

47:31.59
bkardell
Um.

47:45.15
Kilian
Know where where should this be fixed but then at the same time I usually find a workaround and that that that workaround is something I can do in my own product. So instead of um, no learning c plus plus is what it comes down to. Um I end up fixing it in my own product. But for example I have ah chromium extension and Firefox and all right etc called fix alley and what that does is it automatically fixes contrast issues on webpages.

48:23.80
Kilian
And that's available for free on all the browsers that I can put it on and that uses the same technology that polypain uses to suggest colors for contrast issues and is that it just applies them so you can Toggle that on as an end user. And then all the websites you visit won't have contrast issues and will be readable so I tried to give back in in that way as well.

48:48.35
Eric Meyer
So yeah, which is great but that also and it's it's interesting that you bring up that you're working like with the chromium of devtools people does that make you at all concerned that like chromium might just take all your ideas from polyppain and make them native. Like what we in the Apple world call being sherlocked.

49:09.72
Kilian
Um, um, yeah so um.

49:17.27
bkardell
And maybe while you think about that Eric can explain what it means to be sherlocked.

49:23.93
Eric Meyer
Sorry yeah to being sherlocked is there was a there was a helper app in the what was then the mac o no was it the os ten world I don't know anyway, there was a mac only thing called Watson which was ah supposed to be. Basically ah sort of like a helper utility and then Apple added like updated sherlock which is also a helper thing to use all of to to offer all of the things that Watson was doing and Watson basically went out. Basically didn't have a model anymore because the operating system did it natively so that's you know I just do you have any concerns or do you feel like the browser. You know the chromium team is happy to work with you to figure out what needs to be done um to make. What you're doing easier but they don't really want to go there themselves.

50:27.39
Kilian
Um, so.

50:33.23
Kilian
Um, the this is really really difficult to to answer. Um because I have quite a lot of mixed feelings on it. But I'll I'll try it anyway. Um.

50:38.13
Eric Meyer
So good.

50:50.82
Kilian
I mean sorry I I should thought for a proper answer here like the the longer short of it is yeah yeah.

50:55.46
bkardell
You take take your time. It's fine. Take your time. Yeah, even even try it 2 3 times if you want that's fine.

50:57.49
Eric Meyer
Yeah, absolutely take your time and if you want to like exactly if you want to think out loud and then summarize after we just include the summary. It's fun.

51:02.99
Kilian
Yeah, so that so that the the long and short of it is everyone working on the Dev tools at all The browsers are really cool people. All of them have also. Already copied feature from polypain and have given me very nice compliments about that. Ah, which is extremely validating but it's also something that you know I came up with I spend a lot lot of time on I make a living from. And then they take it and give it away for free. Ah, which gives it all a very ah you know double feeling like it's very validating but but I also need to pay my rent.

51:59.54
Kilian
Ah, so encapsulating that in a nice answer is is a little difficult.

52:04.38
bkardell
Yeah I think so like if it helps I don't know what you know about Aalia but agaia is ah cooperative. It's a consultancy and all we do is work on open source and like we are the number 2 after Google Contributor to chromium.

52:05.94
Eric Meyer
Ah.

52:13.44
Kilian
Um, yeah, yeah.

52:22.80
bkardell
Number 2 after Apple to webkit in the up few and Firefox and you know like ah and notches those also in like ah other areas of like.

52:25.73
Kilian
Um, yeah, you.

52:36.36
Kilian
Mobile browsers etc. Yeah.

52:38.99
bkardell
Graphics drivers and Multimedia and all kinds of stuff and basically you know we have um you know a little bit of the same sort of dilemma like we we need to get. We love open source. We love all the things about it. But also we need to get paid. Um, because.

52:55.43
Kilian
A.

52:58.78
bkardell
We have bills to pay. We live in a society that is capitalist. You know like um that demands that we pay rents and mortgages and all those things. So um.

53:01.30
Kilian
Yeah, yeah.

53:17.45
bkardell
You know like I think I don't like I don't know if you're like super happy with your articulation if you wanted to try it again. But but like I think. It's not surprising that it is in like a thing that you can have very mixed feelings about right like Chrome the browser.

53:42.10
Kilian
Me.

53:51.73
bkardell
Or like Safari is you know, proprietary right? But webkit is open source you know, um and it's you know.

53:57.99
Kilian
A.

54:10.52
bkardell
It's a tough thing for Apple to be like well here's a proprietary thing and let's give it back to webkit or to to even imagine that like all the browsers aren't going boy that's a really cool feature x made how do we get it in our browser you know? um.

54:16.53
Kilian
In here.

54:24.42
Kilian
Um, yeah.

54:29.64
bkardell
So I yeah's I mean I feel like it's very confusing and not confusing. It's complex right? Yeah, and yeah I don't know if you if you want to try it again I think we can take what you have and like make it nice or if you.

54:36.19
Kilian
Yes.

54:48.64
bkardell
Want to try it again and.

54:49.96
Kilian
No I Yeah I want to try it again because this was like the most candid probably want to phrase it a little less candidly. Um.

55:05.19
Kilian
Yeah, so for for all the major browsers like their their main concern I think is never going to be developers. However, all of them. Ah, or at least like the the big 3 They I think they do see developers as ah as a target audience worth pursuing. Ah because if the developers use your browser then. They build to the capabilities of your browser and the users of your browser will benefit because they have those capabilities whereas other browsers. Maybe don't and so users of those browsers will move to your browser to make sure that they can use. Websites They want to use and I think that's true for most of the major browsers and that's also why they offer the developer tools. Um, there are features.

56:14.54
Eric Meyer
Okay, now.

56:18.72
Kilian
Like from polyppain that have landed in Chrome in firefoxs etc and I've I you know I've a bit mixed feelings about that on the one end. Um, you know they can do that. Ah. And I'm also no proud that my ideas were good enough for you know multibillion dollar companies to also implement. Um, and you know the people. Are implementing them I am in contact with them and they're they're all very nice people and they all share the same enthusiasm I have about developer tooling. So ah, it's there's nothing insidious there we were literally all just trying to build the best thing. For developers. However, um, you know a developer working on Chrome or on edge. They don't have to worry about the? ah. The longevity of their company. They can just build and ship because you know those companies will keep existing ah because they have income from you know, wildly different different things than the browser. Ah for me. However.

57:54.41
Kilian
Like this is my this is my my income my job. Um, so having like a huge company in like the most most bus banal Most banal way you know. Take something I came up with and then give it away for free I Very make feelings about that. Um.

58:27.62
Kilian
All in all though, um I don't think that those browsers are ever going to let the developer tools break out of their box. Um, what I've done in polypain really requires like. Everything about the browser to be Dev Toolsol focused and that's just not going to work for a browser where the vast majority of users should never see developer tooling.

59:02.82
bkardell
Yeah.

59:04.79
Kilian
Ah, so you know I hope that that's where the balance is um and you know that's that's the the complicated feelings I have on that on that topic.

59:09.31
Eric Meyer
Right.

59:16.59
Eric Meyer
What totally fair. Yeah I mean and that I I suspected when I asked the question that it might have a complicated answer because yeah, it's you you make a thing you get and. Absolutely, you should be 100 % 110 percent proud of what you've made because it really is very unique and very ah powerful for people who do develop websites or or you know possibly even web apps I I can't speak as much of that because I don't do that. But you know.

59:55.16
Eric Meyer
There's There's so much there and so many things that um, you know when I come across them in Polypae I Often say Wow I Wish this had been in devtools Forever right? But like you say it's. There's only so much that they're likely that that devote that those companies are likely to devote to developing developer tooling because that isn't their primary audience. Yes, It's an audience that's worth courting but it's not the ah like they haven't They're not centering that audience. They're centering the user who hopefully will never ever see. Devtool because like you say they'll become completely confused by them. Um, whereas you're absolutely centering developers. Um, and that that leads to very different decisions, different development decisions and design decisions speaking of which do you know if there's a. Name for the design pattern that you're using with all you know having a bunch of windows in ah and a single big canvas and if not would you like to name it.

01:00:57.36
Kilian
Um, honestly, no, um, I'd have to think about that like that like in in general like there is the concept of. Ah, canvas space tools which polypane isn't quite because the the concept of a canvas space tool is that you can Zoom and pan around it like you had like a huge desk and you can just shuffle papers all all across it.

01:01:32.56
Kilian
Um, whereas Poly Pane is kind of like the light version of that. Ah, because I I try to move people away from doing too much sizing management. Um, but yeah I I'd have to think about that. I Could facesigiously call it The the polyppane Pattern has a nice ring to it.

01:01:53.52
Eric Meyer
So I don't think that's yeah I don't think that's facetious I think that sounds pretty good. So well this has been really great. Um, thank you so much for joining us. Um, where can people find you.

01:02:00.54
bkardell
Yeah, so.

01:02:11.77
Eric Meyer
Online.

01:02:13.40
Kilian
Ah, you can find me at Killian Fkoff Dot Com and from there you can find links to boypain to fix ali to everything I do.

01:02:25.64
Eric Meyer
You Yeah and where ah where can people go ah directly to find polyppain so they can ah see what you've created and give you money.

01:02:35.59
Kilian
That's at polypain dot app. Ah, and you don't have to give me money straight away. There's a free trial no strings attached. You can just download it and try it and if it is for you. Please let me know and if it isn't for you. Please Also let me know ah because I really enjoy all the feedback I get.

01:02:58.69
Eric Meyer
You awesome! Thank you Killian really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.

01:03:03.00
bkardell
Yeah, this was really really interesting.

01:03:06.83
Kilian
Thank you guys as well.
